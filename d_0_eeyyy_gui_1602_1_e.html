                <h1>Introduction to the Diploma programme</h1>
                <div class="chapter">
                    <h2>The Diploma programme [Placeholder h2]</h2>
                    <p>The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and be able to evaluate a range of points of view.
                        </p><h3>The Diploma Programme model</h3><p>
                        The programme is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility and can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

                        </div>
                    <h3>Choosing the right combination</h3>
                    <p>Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can choose a second subject from groups 1 to 5 instead of a group 6 subject. Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
                      </p> <p>At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework that is assessed by teachers.

                <h1>General introduction to the core of the Diploma Programme</h1>
                <div class="chapter">
                    <h2>The core of the Diploma Programme</h2>
                    <p>All Diploma Programme students participate in the three elements that make up the core of the programme:</p>
                       <ul><li>theory of knowledge</li>
                       <li>creativity, activity and service</li>
                        <li>the extended essay.</li></ul>
                       <p> These three elements of the core complement each other, working together to achieve the following common aims:
                       </p><ul><li>to support, and be supported by, the academic disciplines
                        </li><li>to foster international-mindedness
                       </li><li>to develop self-awareness and a sense of identity.</li></ul>
                        
                       <p><strong>Theory of knowledge (TOK)</strong> is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The role of TOK is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of their own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
                        </p><p><strong>Creativity, activity, service (CAS)</strong> is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are:
                        </p>
                    <ul><li>creativity (arts and other experiences that involve creative thinking)
                        </li><li>activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) 
                        </li><li>service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). 
                        </li></ul>
                    <p>The emphasis in CAS is on helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. 
                        </p><p>Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
                      </p> <p><strong>The extended essay</strong>, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. Students select an area of research from Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of the interdisciplinary world studies essay from two subjects, and  become acquainted with the independent research and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. As an authentic learning experience, the extended essay provides students with an opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

              <h3>Inquiry and the extended essay</h3>
              
              <p>
                 The extended essay is perhaps the most inquiry-based activity that students will undertake, especially given that it is a completely open-ended task, directed by student interest. This is not coincidental: the extended essay is intended to encourage students to examine significant issues and areas of research that they personally care about in an in-depth and meaningful way. Through their research, students can learn not only about the topic of their research, methodology, and critical thinking, but they can also learn important transferable skills such as time management, perseverance, resilience, and decision-making.

                    As young individuals and as members of local and global communities, students make sense of the world through their life experiences and the world around them. IB programmes emphasize contextualized teaching because the more students can relate their learning to real-life contexts the more likely they are to engage with it. Equally valuable is that through enabling students to see the applications of their learning, contextualized teaching, like conceptually focused teaching, helps students to get to the heart of why they are learning what they are learning.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    In order to appreciate the role of contexts for relevant learning, it is helpful to think of contexts as students’ frames of reference. When they are learning in a contextualized way, students are grounding abstract ideas and new information in familiar real-life situations. In a classroom in which contextualized teaching is happening, concepts and theories are related to accessible and meaningful examples, illustrations and stories, which in turn inform further conceptual and theoretical understandings.
                 </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Conceptual understanding and the extended essay</h3>
              <p>
                 In the extended essay, concepts play an important role in helping to frame the focus of the research students are undertaking, and also as a demonstration of their knowledge and understanding.  Students who are able to engage critically in discussion about the concepts relevant to their area of research are able to demonstrate at a deeper level how different aspects of their learning are connected.
              </p>
              <p>
                 In the DP, as well as in the Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP), these cognitive, metacognitive and affective skills are grouped into the same five ATL categories.

              <h3>Local and global contexts and the extended essay</h3>
              <p>
                 In extended essays contemporary examples, case studies and real-life engagement with local and global issues can bring students’ research to life. This is particularly true for students choosing to complete a world studies extended essay, where the focus is on a contemporary issue of global significance. These issues tend to be dynamic, varied and present at all levels of global social organization; global issues have local ramifications and local issues are often a part of a wider phenomenon. Different factors can prompt students to choose to engage with an issue such as CAS activities or the desire to further investigate an issue raised in an individual subject but from a different perspective. Students who choose to focus on a global issue tend to have an interest in global issues generally, wanting to explore them through different disciplinary and interdisciplinary lenses.

              <p>
                 Although the extended essay is an independent task, students should be guided through the process by an appointed supervisor. The supervision and reflection process is to ensure that students are given the opportunity to explore ideas, issues and challenges in a supportive environment. Using evidence from their Researcher’s reflection space, students can engage in discussions with their supervisor about the direction and progress of their research, establishing working objectives and timelines.

IB programmes emphasize contextualized teaching because the more students can relate their learning to real-life contexts the more likely they are to engage with it. Equally valuable is that through enabling students to see the applications of their learning, contextualized teaching, like conceptually focused teaching, helps students to get to the heart of why they are learning what they are learning.

                    In order to appreciate the role of contexts for relevant learning, it is helpful to think of contexts as students’ frames of reference. When they are learning in a contextualized way, students are grounding abstract ideas and new information in familiar real-life situations. In a classroom in which contextualized teaching is happening, concepts and theories are related to accessible and meaningful examples, illustrations and stories, which in turn inform further conceptual and theoretical understandings.

              <h3>Meeting the needs of all learners and the extended essay</h3>
              <p>
                 Although the extended essay is an independent task, guided by common criteria across all subjects, supervisors play an important role in guiding students to choose areas of research that allow them to demonstrate their ability within the subject area. Identifying and refining an appropriate and feasible research question early on in the process is crucial. Additionally, throughout the research process supervisors can offer guidance and support–within the parameters of the task–at different levels for different students. For example, some students may not require the full five hours of supervision time permitted, whereas others will.
              </p><p>
                 At the beginning of the process, the Diploma Programme/Extended Essay coordinator may wish to provide differentiated learning materials related to research methods and academic honesty to students. This could be in the form of study skills classes focused on research or note-taking, for example, or reading materials related to these.

              <h3>Assessment and the extended essay</h3>
              
              <p>The extended essay is assessed using generic assessment criteria complemented by subject-specific interpretations of the criteria. Students should have access to this early on in the process so that they are clear about how their work will be assessed. They should also be able to view exemplars of extended essays along with the accompanying examiner comments.
              </p><p>
                 Through the supervision and reflection process, as part of the learning process, students should be tracking their progress, monitoring specific issues and reflecting on their own learning and skills development.

              <h3>Thinking skills and the extended essay</h3>
              
              <p>In the extended essay thinking skills play a key role, especially in terms of providing students with the opportunity to demonstrate a deeper understanding of a very specific area of research. While metacognition is a skill that is embedded in Diploma Programme courses, in the extended essay critical thinking and reflection skills have a central role. Working on a specific area of research and engaging with different sources of information and data, students become exposed to different and new perspectives on issues and topics.  
              </p><p>
                 The extended essay assessment criteria require students to engage with their research in an analytical and evaluative way. Further to this, the skill of reflection, particularly in relation to the process of conducting research, is highly valued. The mandatory reflection sessions and engagement assessment criterion place a high value on the benefits structured reflection can have on a student’s learning and progress.
              </p><p>
                 Through the Researcher’s reflection space students are encouraged to reflect using a variety of different techniques, including written reflections, video diaries, blogs or MindMaps©, for example.

               <h3>Overview of the body [heading 3]</h3>
               
               
               <p>The anthropology of the body is an exciting and diverse area of research which provides
                  a balance between more classic areas of anthropological study, such as the ritualised
                  body or localised bodies, and new emerging areas, such as experiential bodies or mechanised
                  bodies. However the body, or bodies, are examined what is clear within this area of
                  research is the centrality of the body to understanding how people experience and
                  make sense of their worlds.
               </p>
               
               <p>Whilst it was Marcel Mauss in 1936 who argued that ‘body techniques’ should be the
                  focus of anthropological study, it was not until much later that ‘the body’ as an
                  area of research began to emerge with any dominance in social and cultural anthropology.
                  These areas of research have sought to explore the body as more than a ‘natural object’
                  but instead a constitutive dimension of everyday cultural and social practices.  In
                  other words, how meanings and values are produced on, and about the body.
               </p>
               
               <p>Theorising about the body within anthropology has been prolific in recent years and
                  more recently has been closely linked to the rise in questions about the bio-politics,
                  suffering, and commodification: Mauss (1985) talked about how people are enculturated
                  through their bodies; Douglas (2002) refers to the role of the body as a metaphor
                  for making sense of the world; Foucault (1973, 1977) argued that we are trained through
                  our bodies to be modern subjects; Csordas (1990, 1994) seeks to understand human participation
                  in the cultural world through embodied experience and Turner (1996) points out that
                  projects of the self are also projects of the body; even Bourdieu (1977) offers his
                  theory of ‘habitus’ to explore the relationship between social structure and embodied
                  experience; and the Comaroff’s have highlighted the role of corporality in the practices
                  of opposition and resistance. 
               </p>
               
               <p>In this area of inquiry, the centrality of the body in anthropology can be explored
                  in a number of contexts, and through a range of inquiry specific concepts. An examination
                  of ‘the body’ as a historically and culturally contingent category, which can for
                  example be seen as the material focus of ‘everyday practices’, whether as an object
                  of self-identification, or the subject of social control, for example. In teaching
                  this area of inquiry the following questions may be useful in framing discussions:
                
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>How is culture inscribed on the body?</li>
                  
                  <li>How do persons inhabit bodies?</li>
                  
                  <li>How are mechanised and medical technologies changing the ways in which people think
                     about and experience the body?
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Can we have persons without bodies and bodies without persons? In other words, what
                     is the relationship between the body and the self?
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>How is the body used as a form of resistance to the mechanisms of power?</li>
                  
                  <li>In what ways is the human body shaped by socio-cultural, historical and political
                     processes? Furthermore, how in turn does it shape them?
                   
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               <p>This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings which serve
                  as analytical frameworks, and topic based exploration. In approaching the teaching
                  of this area of inquiry it would be useful to begin with examining how human bodies
                  are the product of both biology and culture and compare the relationship between the
                  body, mind and society across time and place. The body should be explored critically
                  questioning the notion of it as a natural, universal object. It should be explored
                  in terms of how bodies are perceived, understood, and experienced in a number of contexts.
                  In others words, in choosing the topics to study and ethnographies to read attention
                  should be given to the body as a lived experience encompassing all its social and
                  symbolic relationships.

            <p>The material consists of background information and resources for EE coordinators
               and supervisors. Some of the resources are also for students. The TSM is divided into
               four sections. The third section provides specific support for the world studies extended
               essay (WSEE)—although there may be aspects that are useful for supervisors and students
               of disciplinary essays. All other sections apply to all EEs, including that for world
               studies.

            <p>This TSM builds on research and practice and is designed to help coordinators and
               supervisors guide student learning. You are encouraged to read the various sections
               before you embark on supervision. You should then revisit particular sections as needed.
               Selected sections will be useful in terms of collaborative planning, particularly
               those in relation to the implementation of the EE process, supervision and reflection
               sessions.

            <h2>Students and the teacher support material</h2>
            <p>It is the supervisor’s role to judge the particular needs of students at specific
               moments in the research process. It is intended that some sections of this TSM be
               shared with students during supervision sessions, as deemed appropriate. However,
               the materials provided here are not intended to replace the supervisor’s role and
               should not be shared with students in full. When using any of the materials with students,
               you will need to discuss with them how these will inform their research.

            <h2>Choice of topic</h2>
            <p>The EE is an in-depth study of a focused topic. Students choose their topic from the
               list of available Diploma Programme subjects for the session in question. For those
               taking the IB diploma, this is normally one of the student’s six chosen subjects.
               It may also be a subject that a course candidate has a background in.

         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Skills—research, writing, reflection</h2>
            <p>The EE gives students the opportunity to research a topic of their own choice, under
               the guidance of a supervisor.
            </p>
            <p>Students then undertake a major piece of formally presented, structured writing. They
               communicate their ideas and findings in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate
               to the subject chosen.
            </p>
            <p>All students are required to undertake three reflection sessions with their supervisor.
               The third is a short, concluding interview, or viva voce, following the completion
               of the essay.

            <h2>Assessment</h2>
            <p>The reflection process is assessed under criterion E: engagement using the 
               <em>Reflections on planning and progress form</em> (RPPF).
            </p>
            <p>The essay itself is assessed against common criteria, interpreted in ways appropriate

            <h2>Key features of the EE</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>The EE is compulsory for all students taking the Diploma and is an option for course
                  students.
               </li>
               <li>A student must achieve a D grade or higher for the EE to be awarded the Diploma.</li>
               <li>The EE is externally assessed. Together with the grade for theory of knowledge, it
                  contributes up to three points to the total score for the Diploma.
               </li>
               <li>The EE process helps prepare students for university and other pathways beyond the
                  Diploma Programme.
               </li>
               <li>Students must choose a subject for their essay from the list of Diploma Programme
                  subjects in the 
                  <em>Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme</em> for the session in question.
               </li>
               <li>The EE is a piece of independent research on a topic chosen by the student in consultation
                  with a supervisor in the school.
               </li>
               <li>It is presented as 
                  <strong>a formal piece of sustained academic writing</strong> (4,000 words maximum) accompanied by 
                  <strong>a reflection form</strong> (500 words maximum).
               </li>
               <li>It is the result of approximately 40 hours of work by the student.</li>
               <li>Students are supported by a supervision process recommended to last three to five
                  hours in total, which includes three mandatory reflection sessions.
               </li>
               <li>The third and final mandatory reflection session is the viva voce, which is a concluding
                  interview with the supervising teacher after the essay is completed.

                     the level descriptor. It is not necessary for every indicator of a level descriptor
                     to be met for that mark to be awarded.

         <h2>How the EE fits within the Diploma Programme core</h2>
         <p>All Diploma Programme students participate in the three components that make up the
            core of the programme:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>theory of knowledge (TOK)
              
            </li>
            <li>creativity, activity and service
              
            </li>
            <li>the EE.
              
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>These three components of the core complement each other, working together to achieve
            the following commons aims:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>to support, and be supported by, the academic disciplines
              
            </li>
            <li>to foster international-mindedness
              
            </li>
            <li>to develop self-awareness and a sense of identity.
              
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>This section shows how the EE fits within the Diploma Programme in terms of:</p>

         <h2>Skills development in the EE</h2>
         <p>The process of researching and writing the EE represents the learner profile in action.
            Being open-minded, principled and reflective are key. The EE allows students to develop
            skills required for both tertiary education and employment in the 21st century. These
            skills relate closely to both the assessment criteria of the EE and approaches to
            teaching and learning
            within an IB education.

         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>CAS as inspiration</h2>
            <p>Students’ involvement in CAS (creativity, activity, service) activities often inspires
               their EE. Students are motivated by an interest that has developed outside of the
               normal context of the classroom, which allows them to make connections between different
               aspects of their learning.
            </p>
            <p>The personal and local context can enhance students’ learning. It can also help them
               develop additional learner profile attributes as their research may, for example,
               then lead to further community action.

               <ul>
                  <li>A student involved in a house-building project in Tanzania attended a festival and
                     witnessed the dances performed there in celebration.
                  </li>
                  <li>The student writes a dance EE exploring the way in which particular dance styles reflect
                     the everyday practices of communities.
                  </li>
                  <li>A student involved in a community project in the Philippines noticed houses having
                     solar bottles built into the roof. These small homes have no windows and electricity
                     supplies can be intermittent.
                  </li>
                  <li>The student undertakes a physics essay investigating how to maximize the area of the
                     home that can be illuminated by a solar bottle.
                  </li>
                  <li>A student took part in a project to clean up a nature reserve that had been vandalized.
                     During the clean-up a pond was discovered.
                  </li>
                  <li>The student writes an environmental systems and societies EE that focuses on monitoring
                     the biodiversity of the pond over a given period of time.
                  </li>
                  <li>A student took part in a community-based project working with a local theatre group
                     and primary school students.
                  </li>
                  <li>The student undertakes a theatre EE exploring the role of theatre in bringing about
                     social change.

            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>WSEE</h3>
               <p>This essay offers students the opportunity to make an in-depth, interdisciplinary
                  study of an issue of contemporary global significance.
               </p>
               <p>Students can choose to explore a topic under one of the following global themes:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>conflict, peace and security</li>
                  <li>economic and/or environmental sustainability</li>

               <h3>CAS</h3>
               <p>CAS enables students to become involved in a longer-term, collaborative project and
                  become members of a community. As a result, they develop a sense of responsibility
                  to each other and to their environment.

               <h3>Overlap between WSEE and CAS</h3>
               <p>This fits nicely with one of the goals of the WSEE: to advance students’ global consciousness.
                  Through CAS, students can be exposed to a particular global issue as manifested at
                  their local level. The students can then further their understanding of the issue
                  through academic research and writing the EE.
               </p>
               <p>This may in turn lead to a more considered involvement in CAS, and to further service
                  activities within the community.

         <h2>The EE and TOK</h2>
         <p>The EE and the theory of knowledge (TOK) course are both concerned with interpreting
            and evaluating evidence, and constructing reasoned arguments.
         </p>
         <p>Where the two differ is in the emphasis placed on the research process and its formal
            outcomes. These aspects are of primary importance in the EE but less so in the theory

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Both TOK and the EE promote reflection on the nature of knowledge and on how new knowledge
               is produced.
            </p>
            <p>The EE also requires students to reflect on the research process, in terms of the
               skills they acquire and develop.

            <p>Critical thinking is central to both the EE and TOK.</p>
            <p>During their EE research, students engage with different sources of information and
               are exposed to new perspectives on issues. They are required to think all of this
               through in an analytical and evaluative way.

            <h2>Time frame</h2>
            <p>The EE process—from selecting a topic through to submitting the completed essay—should
               take four to eight months. Within that period, the student should spend approximately
               40 hours on the task. If the time frame is too long, students risk losing their momentum
               and direction, and if it is too short, they may not have sufficient time to fully
               explore their topic and develop the requisite skills. The model adopted will vary
               according to school context.

         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>The role of the supervisor</h2>
            <p>Students and schools should work together to find an appropriately qualified supervisor
               from the school for each student. It is advisable that supervisors are familiar with
               the specific discipline involved, or more generally with the problem or issue under
               study.
            </p>
            <p>The primary responsibility for the essay lies with the student, but the supervisor
               mentors the student through each stage of the process.
            </p>
            <p>A good student–topic–supervisor fit is likely when the supervisor:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>knows the student well</li>
               <li>shares the student’s excitement and curiosity about the topic</li>
               <li>is comfortable establishing a clear work plan with the student</li>
               <li>follows up with timely feedback.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The supervisor should:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>mentor the student with advice on the skills of undertaking the research process
                 
               </li>
               <li>encourage and support the student throughout the research and writing of the EE
                 
               </li>
               <li>guide the student in formulating a well-focused research question that satisfies appropriate
                  legal and ethical standards
                 
               </li>
               <li>ensure that the student understands the importance of using credible/accurate sources.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The supervisor is 
               <strong>not</strong> responsible for verifying specific content within the students’ EE. The supervisor
               
               <strong>is</strong> responsible for verifying that the essay is the students’ own work and that the students
               have properly acknowledged all their sources.

               <h3>Preparation</h3>
               <p>It is vital that the student and supervisor are well prepared for each session. For
                  example, the student may need to send some materials to the supervisor in advance
                  (such as parts of the essay, or excerpts from the RRS). At stage three, students must
                  submit their full draft to the supervisor in good time for them to read and provide
                  feedback to the student.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Timing</h3>
               <p>In the model below, the first three sessions take place quite close together (possibly
                  within one month) as they are important in establishing the preliminaries for the
                  essay. This work provides the essential preparation for the first reflection session.
               </p>
               <p>After this session, the student should clarify the research question to guide their
                  inquiry in preparation for the interim reflection session.
               </p>
               <p>At this point, there will likely be a period from one to three months (eg a long vacation)
                  while the student is building the body of the essay, culminating in a completed draft
                  to be ready for the third check-in session.
               </p>
               <p>There is likely to be over a month between the third check-in session and the final
                  reflection, the viva voce.

         <h2>Contracting</h2>
         <p>Contracting is the process of reaching agreement between supervisor and student about
            how they will work together and their expectations of each other. It is the basis
            of their understanding of their working relationship for the duration of the student’s
            EE process.
         </p>
         <p>Each student works in a different way and the supervisor first needs to find out how
            a particular student learns and thinks. Then they will be able to choose together
            the most appropriate forms of support for that student.
         </p>
         <p>This section offers three teaching ideas for establishing a good working relationship
            between supervisor and student:

            <h2>The shield</h2>
            <p>This might be a pre-drawn shield divided into four or the supervisor can simply ask
               the student to divide a page into four. Each part is given a heading:

            <p>Each shares their list with the other and together they draw up a list of the guidelines

               will be run and for the supervisor to clearly state how to give feedback in different
               ways. It is therefore important to establish how this will work for each individual
               student to make sure any feedback or evaluation is constructive and achieves its purpose.

            <h2>The lotus</h2>
            <p>This is an exercise that can be used to generate ideas. It works on a “blossoming”
               principle. The students draw a box in the centre of the page and write their area
               of inquiry inside it. They then draw four diagonal lines from each of the four corners
               of the square and draw a square at the end of each line. This creates a central box
               surrounded by four smaller boxes. They write aspects related to their area of inquiry
               in each of the four smaller boxes.

            <p>They then draw four diagonal lines from each of the four corners of the four smaller

               the areas they have identified in the smaller boxes. This creates a central box surrounded
               by four smaller boxes, each surrounded in turn by four more small boxes. This exercise
               gives students the opportunity to identify key ideas and the various aspects that
               need to be examined.
            </p>
            <p>It provides a good starting point for the supervisor and the student to discuss the
               nature of the EE and the various aspects the student needs to explore.

      <div class="chapter">
         <h2>Questioning</h2>
         <p>The supervisor can help the students reflect by careful questioning:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>basic questioning: “Why did you do that?”</li>
            <li>academic: “How might you explain this?”</li>
            <li>personal: “How are you getting on?”</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Questions that help student reflection can be divided into five categories:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Patterning questions: </strong>questions that connect knowledge and understanding in order to generate new insights
               and perspectives.
            </li>
            <li>“What is the relationship between architecture and politics?”</li>
            <li>
               <strong>Dynamic questions: </strong>“how” questions that are related to action and process.
            </li>
            <li>“How will I make this model of a structure stand without support?”</li>
            <li>
               <strong>Speculative questions: </strong>questions that look at the possibilities and encourage creativity using “if” as key
               wording in the question.
            </li>
            <li>“What if we build underwater?”</li>
            <li>
               <strong>Evaluative questions: </strong>questions that measure the extent to which something has been achieved or has been
               successful against predetermined criteria and goals.
            </li>
            <li>“To what extent is an underwater structure safe?”</li>
            <li>
               <strong>Affective questions: </strong>questions that have a pastoral motivation and are designed to check the students’
               well-being, progress and feelings about their learning and progress.
            </li>

            <h2>To the answer … and beyond</h2>
            <p>The point at which students believe they’ve got near to a solution is the very point
               when they should be asking more complex questions. This will lead them not just to
               the solution but beyond it, producing original and innovative approaches to the area
               of inquiry. It is the supervisor’s role to help them achieve this.

      <div class="chapter">
         <h2>Feedback and evaluation</h2>
         <p>Evaluation, including self-evaluation, is another distancing
            technique.
         </p>
         <p>It requires the students to look at something (be it their own work or that of another)
            from a distance and to judge it. This judgment of what has been produced and how,
            what has worked and what hasn’t, is measured against pre-set objectives and criteria.
         </p>
         <p>Evaluation may take place at certain points 
            <strong>during</strong> the development of the EE as well as at the 
            <strong>end</strong> of it.
         </p>
         <p>But evaluative reflection and feedback should always be 
            <strong>future-</strong>oriented. They should be formulated in terms of “So what?”, “What impact?”, “What
            next?” and “How next time?”
         </p>
         <p>What to do with feedback, and how to use it, is a key feature of learning through
            reflection. However, feedback has to be managed carefully. Its timing and how it “lands”
            are important things to consider.

            <h2>SAFE framework for feedback</h2>
            <p>The SAFE framework categorizes feedback into four types and is a useful guide for
               supervisors.
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <strong>Share: </strong>This is primarily an exercise in sharing work and ideas. It is judgment-free and is
                  designed to affirm as well as develop the students’ work. The supervisor’s role is
                  to examine the students’ work and to share their ideas and suggestions. There is a
                  sense of collaboration and of trying to solve a problem together.
               </li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Affirm: </strong>This is a response designed to confirm success and achievements, responding to what
                  students have done so far, why and its impact. It is important for students to feel
                  they are making progress and affirmation is particularly useful during the “dips”
                  in the process. Sometimes this is all students need to move them on.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               <em>Timing: any time</em>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Feedback: </strong>General feedback helps students to develop their work and to overcome particular problems
                  and obstacles. It focuses on what they have and haven’t done as well as how they have
                  done it. It examines difficulties as well as possibilities and asks students to reflect
                  on their own approaches and progress.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Evaluate: </strong>This is a measure of the students’ success in achieving goals, answering questions
                  and developing skills. It is based on the students’ work, their original objectives
                  and criteria for success and a discussion about how this evaluation will affect their
                  future work.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               <em>Timing: end of project</em>
            </p>
            <p>The SAFE approach requires the supervisor and the student to decide together which
               type of response is most appropriate at any given time. Negotiating what type of response
               would be most useful can be very helpful, with some provisos.

            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Ask the students to draw a railway line (a vertical line divided by at least five

            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">For each horizontal line on the left-hand side, the students then identify breakthroughs,
               key moments, challenges (and how they were overcome) and triumphs regarding the work
               they have completed.

         <h2>External mentors and the EE</h2>
         <p>The IB expects that students will undertake the research for their EE and be supervised
            by a member of staff within the school.
         </p>
         <p>However, there may be cases when students undertake part of their research outside
            their school—for example, at a university or other local institution. This should
            only be in rare circumstances and with explicit permission from the DP/EE coordinator.
         </p>
         <p>These students must still be allocated a supervisor within the school, who will complete
            the reflection sessions and comment on and sign the RPPF.
         </p>
         <p>It is the school’s responsibility to ensure that external mentors understand and are
            clear about the parameters of the guidance they can give.
         </p>
         <p>External mentors are required to sign a copy of the formal letter included in the
            
            <em>Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme</em>
           . This must be given to the external mentor at the start of the process.
         </p>
         <p>The external mentor will also need to electronically sign, date and provide comments
            at the end of the mentoring role.
         </p>
         <p>The letter must be physically inserted in the appendix of the essay as part of the
            student’s EE document file rather than included as a scanned document.
         </p>
         <p>If a student has had an external mentor, this signed letter is an important part of
            the authentication of the essay.

         <p>Students will need help in deciding on their EE topic and question.</p>
         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Subject area and topic</h2>
            <p>Students should first decide which subject area they are interested in and read the

              .
            </p>
            <p>Each EE must be registered under a particular subject area. If students decide on
               a topic without considering the subject, their essay may not fulfil the requirements
               for the area under which it is eventually registered.
            </p>
            <p>An essay that is considered to be inappropriately registered will be compromised across
               the assessment criteria.
            </p>
            <p>Students, with their supervisor’s help, must ensure they understand the requirements
               for the subject under which they are registering their essay. Students should not
               attempt to retrospectively fit an essay into a subject area once they have researched
               and written it.

         <h2>Research within the EE—an overview</h2>
         <p>In order to conduct their research, students must first formulate a concise research
            question for inquiry. This starts out as a “working” research question that they can
            refine as they gather more information during their research.
         </p>
         <p>This section gives an overview of the research process—inquiry, action and reflection
           —and suggests some online resources
           . It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to research methods, but should provide
            some guidance as well as stimulation for seeking additional information and support.
         </p></div>
         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>The research process</h2>
            <p>There are three stages in the research process: inquiry, action and reflection.</p>
            <img src="**insert link url**" alt="**insert alt text**"></img>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Stage 1: Inquiry</h3>
               <p>During this stage, students collect information from a range of sources to help formulate
                  the research question. This may involve talking to people as well as reading.
               </p>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Literature review or secondary research</h4>
                  <p>As part of their inquiry, students should try to read as much as they can of what
                     has already been written about their topic. This is called a “literature review” or
                     “secondary research” (as opposed to carrying out their own “primary” research).
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondary sources may include:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>printed works—books, journals, newspapers, magazines</li>
                     <li>internet sources—websites and articles, journals etc available only online</li>
                     <li>other media sources—films, TV and radio programmes</li>
                     <li>any other published information containing ideas and information relating to the student’s
                        choice of topic.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Students must be sure that their sources are both relevant and reliable. They must
                     consider the credibility of the publication, organization and author as well as the
                     source’s date. They should be aware that search engines themselves may be biased in
                     the sources they suggest.
                  </p>
                  <p>This secondary research helps the students to refine their research question and begin
                     to answer it. It also helps the students to:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>identify additional sources to investigate</li>
                     <li>gain an insight into what methods earlier researchers used</li>
                     <li>consider new aspects of the topic that were outcomes from previous research</li>
                     <li>gain an overview of questions that were asked in past interviews and surveys.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The findings from this reading can stimulate new and creative approaches to further
                     research.

               <h3>Stage 2: Action</h3>
               <p>In the next phase, students formulate their research question and undertake further
                  research to answer it. This may be further secondary research or their own primary
                  research.
               </p>

                  <h4>Primary research</h4>
                  <p>Students carrying out primary research collect their own data. Taking into consideration
                     their findings from the secondary research, they gather the additional information
                     they have identified as required to help them answer their research question.
                  </p>
                  <p>Primary research techniques include:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>setting up experiments</li>
                     <li>extracting information from original documents</li>
                     <li>interviewing experts</li>
                     <li>conducting formal surveys</li>

            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>help contextualize their own area of research within the wider discipline/issue</li>

         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Reliability of secondary sources</h2>
            <p>It is important that the students consult relevant and reliable sources. Students
               need to evaluate the sources that they use for their secondary research.
            </p>
            <p>The question usually emerges about the reliability of wikis, online encyclopaedias
               and other similar information sites
              . These kinds of sources may be useful in the initial stages of research to gain an
               overview of a topic. However, an over-reliance on them should be avoided.

            <p>See also the advice in the guide 
               <em>Using online encyclopaedias and other similar information sites</em>

            <h2>How to take notes, annotate and bookmark</h2>
            <p>Students should be encouraged to take detailed notes from sources that they use.</p>
            <p>There are many different techniques that students can learn. Using their RRS may be
               a good way for many students to collate information in one place.
            </p>
            <p>Some students may need help to become skilled in note-taking. The EE coordinator or
               librarian can organize study skills training for their cohort of students.

            <p>Annotating is an excellent skill for making critical commentary or explanatory notes
               on a piece of text, image or table, for example. It encourages students to read actively.
               They can use different colours to code different parts of a text, underline or circle
               important parts, pose questions or simply express a reaction to what they are reading.
            </p>
            <p>Students can bookmark online sources by using either the bookmarking feature in a
               browser or an online social bookmarking tool such as 
               <a href="https://www.diigo.com/">Diigo</a> (
               <a href="https://www.diigo.com/">https://www.diigo.com/</a>). They can select tags so that they can easily find useful articles and resources
               again. If these tools are deemed useful for students, the EE coordinator may need
               to arrange training for students.

            <img src="**insert link url**" alt="**insert alt text**"></img>
            <p>Likewise, students can copy text and images from online sources into a word processor
               and annotate them, or annotate them online using available tools. The videos listed
               in “Online resources” show both approaches.
            </p>
            <p>Students may wish to create a bibliographic entry at the top of the copied text using
               an online citation service, and the librarian may be able to show them how to undertake
               this with suggested tools. Please note that such citations must meet the minimum requirements
               of the IB as outlined in the 
               <em>Extended essay guide</em> and 
               <em>Effective citing and referencing</em>

         <h2>Creating an annotated bibliography</h2>
         <p>An annotated bibliography provides a concise summary of each source and some assessment
            of its value and relevance. It is excellent preparation for carrying out independent
            research.
         </p>

         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Annotated bibliography—its function</h2>
            <p>The process is not just a matter of listing possible sources. It also requires students
               to think critically. They must consider the sources in terms of:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>what has already been written about their chosen topic and</li>
               <li>how their own research will fit into this.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As they examine each source, students will need to identify the issues and different
               perspectives of others. This will help them to develop their reasoned argument.
            </p>
            <p>A good annotated bibliography will:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Allow students to keep track of their reading.</li>
               <li>Encourage students to think critically about the sources they are using in relation
                  to their own research area.
               </li>
               <li>Allow students, quite early on in the process, to become aware of possible concerns
                  about using certain sources.
               </li>
               <li>Help students determine whether a source is of use to them in their research.</li>
               <li>Help students to justify their use of particular sources, both to their supervisor
                  and to the examiner.
               </li>
               <li>Help students with the planning of their research, and ultimately save them time.</li>
               <li>Enable students to develop their critical thinking skills in selecting and evaluating
                  source material.
               </li>

            <h2>How to compile an annotated bibliography</h2>
            <p>There are many ways to format an annotated bibliography, and librarians may be a good
               source of advice on this. Generally, an annotated bibliography consists of:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>the bibliographic information</li>
               <li>the annotations (a concise summary of the source).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The annotations will vary in length depending on whether the student is writing a
               summary of the source or analysing it.
            </p>
            <p>A summary should include:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>a concise summary of the content and theme(s) of the source</li>
               <li>a comment on the authority of the author</li>
               <li>a comment on the purpose of the source</li>
               <li>a comment on how this source might be useful.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the purpose of primary research?</h2>
            <p>After the literature review or secondary research is completed, students must analyse
               their findings and:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>determine to what extent they answer the research question</li>
               <li>find agreement between authors</li>
               <li>find disagreement, where the evidence reveals differences in points of view or findings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At this point students may decide to investigate further by carrying out their own
               primary research, in other words by collecting their own data.
            </p>
            <p>The students must choose a method or methods that are appropriate to the research
               question and that are commonly used in the particular Diploma subject. Again, students
               must be reminded here that, although the method may be appropriate for the subject,
               it may not be permitted in relation to the EE.
            </p>
            <p>Possible data collection methods include:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>experiments
                 
               </li>
               <li>investigations
                 
               </li>
               <li>interviews
                 
               </li>
               <li>surveys.
                 
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The details of how the data was collected are crucial to the validity of any argument
               based on the findings. Students must put in the main body of their essay the details
               of any primary research they carry out. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>the methods used</li>
               <li>the persons involved</li>
               <li>how and why these were selected</li>
               <li>the relevant results</li>
               <li>any limitations and biases that may have influenced the results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examiners will not refer to, and are not required to read, information presented in
               an appendix, therefore any information relevant to the argument of the essay, or justification
               of the findings presented, must be included in the main body. The assessment of the
               essay will be affected if students put this information in an appendix. However, students
               may need to put some supplementary material into an appendix—for example, the transcript
               of an interview or a list of survey questions (for more guidance on this please see
               “The researching and writing process”
              ).

            <h2>Preparation for primary research</h2>
            <p>Students must follow the accepted process for carrying out their chosen method of
               research—how the data is recorded, analysed and presented. Otherwise, their data will
               have little value.
            </p>
            <p>Students need to plan carefully how to carry out their research. In most cases, there
               will be only one opportunity to collect primary data from a particular source.
            </p>
            <p>It is extremely important that students approach their research in an ethical and
               legal manner. See 
               <em>Ethical guidelines for extended essays research and fieldwork</em>
              .

            <h2>Quantitative vs qualitative research</h2>
            <p>Primary research involves either 
               <strong>quantitative</strong> or 
               <strong>qualitative</strong> research methods.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Quantitative research</h3>
               <p>Quantitative research follows a well-defined process that yields data that can be
                  analysed statistically.
               </p>
               <p>For example:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>outcomes from experiments</li>
                  <li>data collected from surveys where responses involve closed or multiple-choice responses.</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Qualitative research</h3>
               <p>Qualitative research collects information that may reflect opinions or personal perspectives
                  on a particular situation. The data that is collected gives an overall impression
                  and generally cannot be analysed statistically.
               </p>
               <p>For example:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>responses in interviews</li>
                  <li>open-ended questions in surveys.</li>

            <h2>Research methods</h2>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Experiments</h3>
               <p>Experiments can be conducted and their data collected using systematic methods and
                  well-defined processes.
               </p>
               <p>For example:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>using the scientific method in conducting science experiments</li>
                  <li>simulating an experiment on using mobile phone technology to determine the location
                     of a person.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Experiments usually involve quantitative processes to collect and analyse the resulting
                  data.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Investigations</h3>
               <p>Types of investigation include:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>examining original sources, for example:</li>
                  <li>maps</li>
                  <li>photographs</li>
                  <li>historical documents</li>
                  <li>company policies</li>
                  <li>laws</li>
                  <li>original art.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Investigations of original source material can reveal whether a particular situation
                  exists or to what extent it does. Investigations can also extract and analyse data
                  from original sources to demonstrate that a particular outcome does occur.

            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Interviews</h3>
               <p>Interviews may be conducted:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>face-to-face</li>
                  <li>by email</li>
                  <li>by phone</li>
                  <li>by online chat.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Interviews can be with one person or a small group, also called a 
                  <strong>focus group</strong>.
               </p>
               <p>Face-to-face interviews have the advantage of allowing the interviewer to ask follow-up
                  questions during the interview.
               </p>
               <p>Successful interviews require careful preparation, including:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>developing questions related to the research question and the findings from secondary
                     research
                  </li>
                  <li>trialling the questions before the actual interview</li>
                  <li>deciding on the best methodology for conducting and recording the interview</li>
                  <li>making the purpose and use of the data collected well known in advance</li>
                  <li>in some cases, providing the interviewee with the questions in advance</li>
                  <li>assuring the anonymity of the interviewee if requested.</li>
               </ul>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Question design</h4>
                  <p>Questions should be designed to elicit the responses required to help answer the overall
                     research question.
                  </p>
               </div>

                  <h4>Recording the interview</h4>
                  <p>Another consideration is how to record the response. Students must ask the permission
                     of the interviewee if they wish to use any audio-visual equipment during an interview.
                  </p>
                  <p>Please note that electronic submissions are not acceptable, and so an example of a
                     transcript will need to be attached in the appendix. Refer to the section of the guide

                  </p>
                  <p>To collect qualitative data, the survey must ask open-ended questions, which allow

            <h2>Considerations for primary research</h2>
            <p>Whichever method is used, primary research must be well structured and collect data
               relating to people, events or objects.
            </p>
            <p>The data collected must be:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>measurable or observable</li>
               <li>relevant</li>
               <li>reliable</li>
               <li>replicable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Questions for students to consider are:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>What do they want to find out from their primary research?</li>
               <li>How will this relate to the findings from the secondary research?</li>
               <li>How will the data collected relate to the research question they have posed?</li>
               <li>What is the best method to collect relevant and reliable data and from where?</li>
               <li>Are there any ethical or legal considerations to using a primary method that must
                  be taken into account?
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The analysis of primary research includes:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>the analysis of the data collected</li>
               <li>the connections the student makes between the different sources of information used—for
                  example, secondary and primary research.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students should spend time researching:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>what the different primary data collection methods are</li>
               <li>how to use the different methods to obtain reliable results</li>
               <li>how to use the results as evidence to support their essay’s argument.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The supervisor plays a key role here. Considering the advantages and disadvantages
               of different research methods is an essential part of the planning process. This will
               help to ensure that students collect the data and information they need to explore
               their research question.

            <h2>Problems emerging from primary research</h2>
            <p>A badly designed or implemented experiment or investigation will lead to flawed results.
               Students, after consultation with their supervisor, may still write an EE based on
               flawed primary research.
            </p>
            <p>However, it is better to avoid the problem. Primary research can fail because:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>The survey sample is too small or badly controlled so the student cannot reach any
                  conclusions relevant to the research question.
               </li>
               <li>The survey/interview questions do not take proper account of the secondary research
                  findings or the research question, and so do not lead to relevant conclusions.
               </li>
               <li>Unacceptable methods were used to collect information, such as:</li>
               <li>using a recording device without the interviewee being aware that the interview was
                  being recorded
               </li>
               <li>taking photos in prohibited areas</li>
               <li>downloading copyrighted music to demonstrate how it is done.</li>
               <li>These are all examples of where a student might be deemed to have breached IB regulations
                  and ethical guidelines.
               </li>
               <li>Students have used a research method that is not permitted or not appropriate for
                  the subject in which they are submitting their EE.

            <h2>Acceptable methodology and ethical practices</h2>
            <p>Although IB publications cannot cover all possible situations for acceptable methodologies
               and ethical practices, these two provide specific policies to consider:

               and legal considerations. For example, downloading pirated software, music or videos
               or attempting to bypass security systems are not accepted. In the sciences, students
               must adhere to the IB animal experimentation policy
              . Supervisors must ensure that students are aware of, and understand the implications
               of breaching, IB regulations in this regard.

            <h2>Academic honesty</h2>
            <p>There are several IB publications that address how to correctly cite and reference
               sources and also what constitutes academic honesty. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <em>Effective citing and referencing</em>
                 
               </li>
               <li>
                  <em>Academic honesty in the IB educational context</em>
                 
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to these documents, supervisors are advised to refer to the relevant sections
               of this TSM and the 
               <em>Extended essay guide</em>. Students risk their IB Diploma if they are found to have breached IB regulations
               with regard to academic honesty.

         <p>Learning to conduct independent research is a challenge. Teachers will find it easier

            a guide for students
         </h2>
         <p>Your extended essay is a formally written research paper and you should strive to
            present it as professionally as you can.

         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Font and spacing</h2>
            <p>It is strongly recommended that you use a readable 12-point font and double spacing.
               This will also help your examiners read and assess your essay on-screen.
            </p>
            <p>Submitting a paper in the recommended format will set a serious tone. Take a look
               at the example text below formatted in two drastically different fonts. Notice the
               difference in tone and mood—which format would be easier for the examiner to read,
               assess and comment on?

            <p class="Notebody">The revenue received by the government will increase with the increasing prices if
               there is no significant change in demand. As it does not, the revenue will rise but
               not at a steady pace. The sales of used cars will increase the scope of the revenue
               of the government, as its demand will rise as a result of the rise in COE prices of
               relatively new cars. However, its full impact cannot be determined as its supply fluctuates
               in different time periods as the government predefines the number of quotas released
               every six months in a year.

               research question.
            </li>
            <li>Students gather evidence from reliable and relevant secondary sources to begin to
               answer their working research question. They may refine the question as they read.
            </li>
            <li>Students analyse the information they have gathered so far to determine:</li>
            <li>To what extent is the information from the various sources consistent?</li>
            <li>What additional information do they need to answer their question?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Students collect the information they need by primary or further secondary research:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>They compare/contrast the evidence collected from secondary sources with each other
               or with the findings from the primary research and formulate a conclusion that answers
               their research question.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>The balance between secondary and primary research depends on:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>the nature of the research question</li>
            <li>the guidance given for the student’s choice of subject.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The EE must:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>follow ethical practices and academic honesty policies

         <h2>Confusions and misunderstandings</h2>
         <p>The art of reflection, though generally acknowledged as an important aspect of education
            and as a significant feature of all IB programmes, is rarely taught as a discrete
            skill. There is a general, but often vague, understanding about what constitutes reflection.
            It is often defined as personal writing, the description of feelings or the documentation
            of processes or evaluation. Though its significance is recognized, it is often too
            quickly sacrificed if time is an issue and it is quickly consigned to homework. This
            is a natural response as reflection is something that we consider to be primarily
            a personal or even a private process, a notion propagated by the long tradition of
            published diaries and the journals that give us access to the thoughts, discoveries,
            reflections and personal lives of their originators.
         </p>
         <p>There is also a sense that it is such a natural and inherent human faculty, especially
            in relation to learning, that it needs only to be refined rather than taught. The
            development of the skill of reflection is therefore something we see as being “caught”
            rather than “taught”. Teachers recognize and acknowledge meaningful reflection but
            sometimes find it challenging to transform students’ affective descriptions of learning
            experiences into relevant and authentic reflection. Furthermore, we use the word “reflection”
            to describe both a 
            <strong>product</strong>—“Here is my reflection”—and a 
            <strong>process</strong>—“It’s time for reflection”—which can confuse the matter further.

         <h2>Reflection as inquiry</h2>
         <p>The basis of reflection is

            or understanding.

               was learned.
            </p>
            <p>It gives students the opportunity to:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>plan and track their process of learning</li>
               <li>record their discoveries</li>
               <li>make connections with prior learning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The act of reflection:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>is a conscious search for meaning and of making meaning</li>
               <li>enables students to distance themselves from their learning and to view it from the
                  outside
               </li>
               <li>allows students to become aware of their cognitive frameworks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through reflection, students develop an objective understanding of themselves as learners.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Action</h2>
            <p>Reflection is an invisible process that goes on inside our heads constantly. We 
               <strong>consciously</strong> reflect when, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>something significant has happened</li>
               <li>we have a decision to make</li>
               <li>we’re working on something</li>
               <li>we’re stuck</li>
               <li>we’ve just completed something</li>
               <li>we’ve been asked to do something</li>
               <li>we’ve encountered the unexpected or the unfamiliar</li>
               <li>our equilibrium has been disturbed</li>
               <li>we are encountering, anticipating or seeking change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If this reflection is deep enough, it gives us lasting insights or knowledge—what
               we call experience, something we can call up subsequently to help guide our responses.
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Reflection can inform action.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Identity</h2>
            <p>Reflection is a key part of our personal development and identity. It gives us self-knowledge
               and a consciousness regard for who we are and our place in the world.
            </p>
            <p>Our reflections, therefore, can become a complex map that not only directs us towards
               a destination but also charts all the routes we’ve already travelled, the places we’ve
               been to, the resources we’ve had and how we have used them. They locate us and position
               us.
            </p>
            <p>Reflecting on our reflections—
               <strong>secondary reflection</strong>—allows us to distance ourselves from ourselves. It provides us with a process to
               understand ourselves better.
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Reflection enables us to understand ourselves better as people and as learners.</li>
            </ul>
           
         </div>
      </div>
                <div class="part"><h1>Reflection and representation</h1>
      <div class="chapter">
         <h2>Reflection and representation</h2>
         <p>Students have to show evidence of their reflection, so that it can be assessed on
            the RPPF as evidence of their engagement with learning. We often confuse reflection
            with the representation and recording of reflection. The RRS, for example, in a workbook
            or journal and the RPPF are the representations of reflection rather than the reflection
            itself.
         </p>
         <p>For others, reflection is synonymous with evaluation, a judgment based upon the extent
            to which original intentions and goals have been met. Though any of these can constitute
            reflection, it is important for both teachers and students to differentiate between
            them. Both reflection and the representation of reflection have their particular functions,
            formats and processes.
         </p>
         <p>We need, therefore, to be clear about the difference between:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>reflecting</li>
            <li>recording reflection retrospectively</li>
            <li>recording as reflection</li>
            <li>reflecting on reflection (secondary reflection).</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Teachers should ensure that throughout the year students are required to reflect in
            all these different ways.

         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">
            <strong>Reflecting on reflection</strong>, eg students examine the collage they created to represent prior learning. They reflect
            on why they have represented it in that particular way and what it reveals about their
            learning and thought processes.
         </p></div>
         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Breaking the flow</h2>
            <p>We are sometimes reluctant to introduce reflection in case it breaks the flow of the
               learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>However, reflection activities can be carefully placed interventions that intentionally
               break the flow of the experience. Students thus have the opportunity to reflect on
               what was happening and why they did what they did.
            </p>
            <p>These moments of reflection are key to learning and learning to learn. They are moments
               when thought and emotion come together, synthesizing an individual’s cognitive and
               affective responses into an insight.

      </div><div class="part"><h1>Secondary reflection</h1>
      <div class="chapter">
         <h2>Secondary reflection</h2>
         <p>Secondary reflection is the act of reflecting on previous reflections—looking back,
            seeking connections, identifying significance, setting down markers and making meaning.
         </p>
         <p>Secondary reflection:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>examines the relationship between past and present learning</li>
            <li>explores the similarities and differences between the past and the present</li>
            <li>identifies the relationship between the students’ context, their actions and the consequences
               of their actions.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>In doing this, it makes greater sense of the reflection that has been documented (see
            “Study/cognitive journals”
           ).
         </p>
         <p>It is a way of using the past to inform both the present (how I learn and act) and
            the future (my future learning and intended actions). It becomes a marker of learning:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>It connects prior learning with present learning to give depth to understandings.</li>
            <li>It provides a mechanism for goal setting and future planning.</li>

            <h2>Documenting reflections</h2>
            <ul>

                  people present) that may be relevant to how this reflection should be considered in
                  the future.

            <h2>The purpose of written reflection</h2>
            <p>Reflection, through the act of writing, gives students the ability to record and structure
               experience and to make sense of the world. They take ownership of their experiences
               and discover a voice with which to communicate experience and thought.
            </p>
            <p>This notion of voice is referred to in assessment criterion E: engagement. Our personal
               voice is related to the way we perceive and describe experience and the words that
               we use to communicate thought and feeling.
            </p>
            <p>The written reflection captures thought and also enables us to 
               <strong>formulate</strong> thought.
            </p>
            <p>The act of writing becomes not only an act of memory, remembering and recounting,
               but also an act of becoming.
            </p>
            <p>We develop not only our understandings as we write, but our identity, too.</p>

            <h2>Function of reflection in an educational context</h2>
            <p>Three primary functions of written records of reflection in an educational context
               are:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Study/cognitive</strong>—focusing on ideas, research, evaluations, concepts, discoveries.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Process/procedural</strong>—focusing on problem-solving, inspirations, ideas, workings, processes, systems of
                  exploration.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Autobiographical/affective</strong>—focusing on personal rants, raves, achievements, frustrations, discoveries, experiences,
                  insights.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The format of reflection is often determined by the particular record’s function:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Study/cognitive</strong>—words, diagrams and research.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Process/procedural</strong>—fragmented writing, charts, pictures, doodles, experiments. It is very rarely continuous
                  text.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Autobiographical/affective</strong>—visuals (drawings and photographs) and words written in a personal register, focusing
                  on the affective and on the personal.
               </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="NoteHeading1">Ordering the RRS</p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Students can divide the space according to its three functions: study/cognitive; process/procedural;
               autobiographical/affective.
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Students can order the reflections chronologically, with a table of contents to indicate
               which form of reflection each contribution relates to.
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">A loose-leaf folder or electronic space allows students to (re)arrange their reflections
               in a variety of combinations. This provides new insights, helps problem-solving and
               provides opportunities to discuss the material from different perspectives.

            </p>
            <p>This forms the basis of interdisciplinary learning and creative thinking—the ability

               <p>It requires students to recognize the effect of learning on themselves and their future
                  actions and perspectives. It is the process by which they make meaning of their learning
                  and understand how it might be applied or be relevant.
               </p>
               <p>Secondary reflection should also be used to extract the significance from the learning.
                  This is about students being able to understand:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the purpose of the learning</li>
                  <li>its application, and</li>
                  <li>its future use—in other words, its

               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">On the third postcard the students should describe the SIGNIFICANCE of the experience—why

            <h2>Process/procedural journals</h2>
            <p>A process/procedural journal records strategies, processes and procedures for the
               solution to a problem or for the creation of something.
            </p>
            <p>It is focused on inquiry but records all possible routes that may lead to a solution,
               paying attention to both the accidental and the random. It is a road map that includes
               dead ends, one-way streets, abandoned valleys and half-scaled mountains.
            </p>
            <p>This type of journal is often presented as a portfolio, workbook, developmental journal
               or notebook. It lets the reader access the workings and the process of the endeavour.
               It shows errors, reworkings and any rethinking, and includes sudden insights or concerns—all
               directed to solving a particular problem.

            <p class="NoteHeading1">Scaling</p>
            <p class="Notebody">The blank page can be daunting. Working on different scales can be useful and is a
               good way of presenting the student with ready-made boundaries that help to define
               the length of the reflection.
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Ask students to reflect on an A4 paper, postcard, flipchart paper, wallpaper, sticky
               notes, luggage labels, shaped paper, strips or wrapping paper.
            </p>
            <p>If this is to be used as a mode of assessment or a starting point for dialogue, the
               workings need to be authentic. However, this may make them difficult to understand
               or follow. Captioning is therefore a key part of the reflection process for this type
               of journal.

            <p class="NoteHeading1">Inscriptions</p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Ask students to draw a box or a bubble on every blank page in advance.</p>
            <p class="Notebody">This gives them a defined space in which to explain the contents of the page, either
               retrospectively or in advance in the form of an intention.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">These inscriptions guide the reader but also help the students, who may have forgotten
               the original purpose of their scribbling/diagrams.

            <p>The problem may be an equation, a sports match, a project, a scientific experiment
               or the writing of a play—but the process/procedural journal is a quest for a successful
               outcome. It is organic because we attack a problem again and again in different ways
               in order to generate new insights.

               <h3>Productive doubt</h3>
               <p>Each question and each problem is unique and has its own particular procedures. For
                  true creativity to occur and for the unexpected to be discovered, each problem must
                  be approached afresh, going beyond the predictable.
               </p>
               <p>The process/procedural journal is therefore by definition a place of uncertainty and
                  students are best advised to embrace a state of doubt. This is doubt free of anxiety,
                  a productive doubt that leads to curiosity and perseverance. Productive doubt is motivational,
                  encouraging the students to inquire if there’s a better solution even as answers begin
                  to present themselves.
               </p>
               <p>In the procedural journal, insight and inspiration sit among the obvious and the irrelevant
                  and need to be sought out.

               <p class="Notebody">They examine each anchor in relation to each other and then discard no less than three
                  and no more than five that don’t fit in.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">The students reflect on each remaining anchor. They either:</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">generate a question for each in order to examine an anchor further, or</p>

         <h2>RRS—some examples</h2>
         <p>The RRS
            is a personal learning environment that can be either a physical or virtual support
            tool. It is a space in which students are able to record reflections on what they
            are reading, writing and thinking. It can help students to prepare for their reflection
            sessions with their supervisors and inform the discussions that take place. In preparing
            for their reflection sessions students could use their RRS to:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>record their reflections</li>
            <li>respond to artifacts, such as photos, newspaper clippings, Twitter feeds, blogs, etc</li>
            <li>respond to prompts and questions that may arise in the students’ subject areas, TOK
               classes or other aspects of the Diploma Programme
            </li>
            <li>create mind maps</li>
            <li>record emerging questions.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Many students already keep research journals in the planning, researching and writing
            phases of their EE. Encouraging students to develop an RRS will help them manage their
            workload and focus on their EE.

         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>The role of the RRS</h2>
            <p>Created by students to help them plan and make decisions in their research process,
               the RRS fosters critical and evaluative thinking skills.
            </p>
            <p>It also supports the development of 
               <em>Approaches to learning</em>
               skills and the conceptual understandings that occur throughout the research process.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, the RRS tracks the evolution of students’ thinking as they develop their
               argument.
            </p>
            <p>It helps the students to connect personally to the topic and may motivate them in
               meaningful ways to successfully complete the EE.
            </p>
            <p>The RRS is intended to make the entire supervision process more meaningful.</p>
            <p>Insights and information recorded in the RRS are expected to form the basis for, and
               find direct expression in, the essay, reflection sessions and RPPF
              . Students are expected to share excerpts from the RRS in discussions with their supervisor.
               Using these reflections as a point of reference in their supervision sessions, students
               will be able to:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>demonstrate their planning</li>
               <li>discuss what they are learning</li>
               <li>evaluate their progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally, the RRS enables supervisors to authenticate the student voice more effectively
               as the RRS contains elements that will eventually be found in the essay itself.
            </p>
            <p>The following exemplars are just a few of the ways in which students might use their
               RRS.

               <p>Reflection 5 After much research, yet with plenty to go, I have found a few monographs
                  that have proved extremely beneficial in allowing me to answer my research question
                  accordingly. Samir Kassir’s monograph titled 
                  <em>Beirut</em> is probably the best source I have found thus far. The way I typically approach research
                  with a monograph is by looking through its index and using any information available
                  that pertains to my research question. With 
                  <em>Beirut</em>, there is a plethora of information that really allows me to understand all the minor
                  details of what was happening at the time. I also think it is beneficial that Kassir
                  is a native himself, and he experienced pre-war Lebanon, the war, and its aftermath.
                  Although he does not include any personal accounts of the war, being there gives him
                  quite a bit of credibility in my opinion. In addition to that, he does not present
                  the facts in a biased fashion at all, and I think that is important to take into consideration
                  when using a monograph that basically tells you most of what you need to know.Reflection
                  3:When I decided that I was going to be writing my extended essay on history, I knew
                  that I wanted to research Lebanese history. I am familiar with minor details of events
                  that have occurred throughout the course of Lebanon’s history, but I think one event
                  that can have a meaningful and deep analysis made on it is the civil war that occurred
                  during 1975. There are various long-term and immediate causes of this war, and the
                  course of the war was extensive and had extreme consequences on the country’s diplomacy
                  and overall on Lebanon as a nation. Based on the process in which I have studied history
                  in school through the IB, a major way of assessing the war is looking at what actually
                  caused the war. I decided to utilize this approach in order to come up with a research
                  question. After some general research about the civil war, I began to a notice a pattern,
                  which was that much of the blame was attributed to religious causes, as well as a
                  group called the Palestinian Liberation Organization, also known as the PLO. Thus,
                  I decided to question how much the PLO really is to be blamed.

               <h3>Exemplar 10: Economics</h3>
               <p>Reflection 9This extended essay really complemented my knowledge of economics, particularly
                  the concepts that I was taught during microeconomics. These concepts included price
                  discrimination, market structures, revenue and cost. It was valuable for me to see
                  the classroom translate to the real world so well, which only served to increase my
                  interest in the field of economics and my interest in pursuing a business career down
                  the road. I had to learn some concepts by myself—price discrimination graphs and degrees—but
                  I think that it was a positive experience because of how it forced me to go outside
                  of the curriculum to properly support my argument, and it made my research paper that
                  much more independent.Reflection 3I came up with my potential research area of price
                  discrimination in Metro-Detroit area hospitals because of my combined interest in
                  economics and the healthcare industry. My mother is a doctor, and I see her always
                  talking about the impact which new healthcare and insurance policies are having on
                  the hospital’s income and the amount patients are having to pay. Price discrimination
                  is practiced in many of these hospitals, so by analysing the impact on hospital’s
                  efficiency, profit can also be analysed. The topic of price discrimination in hospitals
                  is very dependent on insurance policies, something which is becoming increasingly
                  relevant in today’s world, especially in America. This topic seems to me as if it
                  has a lot of potential to become a comprehensive research essay, considering how it
                  is both specific and can be analysed in many different ways.

         <h2>Supervisors supporting reflection</h2>
         <p>In terms of reflection, all conversations with the supervisor are designed to help
            the students:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>clarify their thoughts and</li>
            <li>reflect on their processes and the development of their work.</li>

         <p>These conversations are comprised of:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>reflection and</li>
            <li>secondary reflection.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>It is easier to reflect on something concrete, so it is recommended that the supervisor
            and the student use 
            <strong>reflection prompts</strong> to encourage discussion.
         </p>
         <p>Reflection prompts can be:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>developed or brought in by the student autonomously</li>
            <li>set, developed or brought in by the supervisor as specific activities</li>
            <li>straightforward excerpts from the RRS.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>It may help supervisors to think in terms of the three mandatory reflection sessions
            corresponding to the three levels of reflection. Students are expected to demonstrate
            how their understanding of the research process has developed while undertaking the
            EE. They may move through the three levels of reflection as they undertake each mandatory
            reflection session.

         <p>The RPPF enables examiners to gain an insight into students’ thinking processes while
            researching and writing the EE. The examiners are looking to see how students’ thinking
            and skills have developed during this time.
         </p>
         <p>The assessment criterion E: engagement will be applied in the assessment of students’
            reflections. Representing 18% of the total grade, this is an extremely important part
            of the overall EE assessment.
         </p>
         <p>It is important to stress with students that examiners want to gain an insight into
            their thinking processes throughout their experience with the EE. 
            <strong>Criterion E assesses the student’s engagement with their research focus and the research
               process. It will be applied by the examiner at the end of the assessment of the essay,
               after considering the student’s RPPF.

         <p>An essay that achieves highly against criteria A–D will not automatically achieve
            highly against criterion E. Students who have struggled with the EE can nonetheless
            achieve quite highly against criterion E. The crucial point is to show what they have
            learned in terms of their understanding of the research process, its challenges and
            their own personal development.
         </p>
         <p>The examiners will read the RPPF together with the EE and will want to be able to
            recognize the student’s voice in their reflections.

         <p>Once students have entered a reflection on the RPPF, they must not amend it with hindsight.
            Amendments will undermine the authenticity of the reflection and may hide the development

                        societies. Before I went any further, my mentor said my topic was too wide and suggested
                        I stick to four magazines, two from each region, and two to three texts from each.
                        This seems a better plan.

                           to completely revise ideas was one of my low points because I felt like I would lose
                           all my initial ideas in the revising process and have to go ahead with something less
                           personally interesting and relevant. The next high point, however, was when I came
                           close to the end of the process; I learned there was a way to keep some of my ideas
                           and pick out the ones that I couldn’t actually do. By mixing them together with some
                           fresh ideas, I think I came out with something just as interesting!

                           from the Middle East, but that proved a lot harder than it seemed at first. She even
                           went so far as to contact the Arab-American Museum in D— to see if they had any copies
                           she could work with. While their library had a substantial collection, it wasn’t quite
                           what she was looking for. A met all of our internal deadlines, actively worked on
                           her EE during the summer, learned a lot through the research process and was excited
                           about her writing. I think she really enjoyed the topic she came up with. Her research
                           question went through a lot of revisions once she had gathered all her research. I
                           thought it was interesting that she brought a little bit of mathematics into the process,
                           analysing her data. I enjoyed working with A during this extended essay process.

                        to do two books that have similar settings, which is war. This first discussion really
                        helped me understand what I needed to do in terms of research. Since my subject area
                        is English, there don’t have to be many other sources to research, but I have to make
                        sure the books I pick have enough elements to compare. I will start by looking at
                        
                        <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em> by Jonathan Safran Foer and 
                        <em>The Things They Carried</em> by Tim O’Brien and analyse PTSD in characters and how the authors reveal themes relating
                        to PTSD.

                        research question. I had learned this about half way through reading my second novel
                        because I realized there wasn’t much to write about if I kept my original question,
                        so I kind of went backwards with my topic selection. People suffer from PTSD after
                        a traumatic event, so the fact that the majority of the plot takes place during the
                        war doesn’t quite work. I discussed this with my supervisor and we came up with “How
                        does literature present the effects of war on the mind?” My supervisor also introduced
                        me to the English database on Gale, and helped me find resources on the exact topic
                        I’m now researching—an article on 
                        <em>Mental Health in Slaughterhouse 5</em> was really helpful and I think I will switch to this book instead of using Foer’s
                        novel.

                        questions I originally planned to use didn’t work out, because I didn’t have enough
                        literary features to write about. In the end I used a quote sheet we had been given
                        in class. This was probably the most useful tool for writing the essay. Essentially,
                        it helped not only with organizing my thoughts, but in determining whether or not
                        the quote would be relevant to the research question. Although the process in writing
                        the extended essay was very tedious and rigorous, it was also a very valuable experience.
                        Relating specifically to my topic, I really enjoyed analysing PTSD in literature.
                        I have always been interested in how the brain functions and disorders associated
                        with the brain. I chose the topic and the novels because I wanted to gain more knowledge
                        about how the brain is affected by external factors such as war, as well as improve
                        my English writing skills at the same time (killing two birds with one stone!).Regardless
                        of the marks I will eventually receive, whether they are good or bad, I am glad to
                        say that this experience will greatly help me at college in the future.

                           good questions and was excited about her content and the process of creating an extended
                           essay. She took time to thoughtfully decide which books she wanted to examine and
                           felt that in the end she made good choices for what she hoped to accomplish in her
                           essay. Like most students R struggled with allocating the needed time to write and
                           revise her work. When she handed in her draft she knew she had some weak areas that
                           needed to be rewritten and strengthened and this was the point where she needed my
                           help the most, so that she was able to reassess her work and make changes before the
                           final submission date. R walks away from this experience with a better understanding
                           of how to work on a long-term project and the tools to apply that knowledge in future.

                        meeting I wanted to know how to approach the civil war—I asked my supervisor what
                        aspects to focus on, and what the time frame should be (1975—?). We decided on discussing
                        the causes of the war, because there is the most room for analysis here. Also, if
                        only the causes are discussed, the essay does not need to go into an in-depth investigation
                        of the actual war. The discussion gave me a better sense of direction for my research.

                        war. With help from my supervisor, I have been able to successfully finish my research
                        and begin writing. I’ve learned that it is important for this essay not to simply
                        be informative, and this has made me realize how significant historiography is. My
                        supervisor thinks I need to find historians with conflicting viewpoints in order to
                        successfully achieve a balanced argument.

                           one would be hard-pressed to identify an example that would hit harder to home. The
                           student is Lebanese, and was surprised by how she was able to maintain an objective
                           distance from this topic, despite her having lived in Lebanon. One difficult aspect
                           involving the research process was getting started in terms of laying the foundation
                           and “nailing down” historians. However, once X got started, and after finding several
                           good sources, everything moved forward smoothly. Another challenge involved time management
                           and the writing and rewriting of the essay. In general, the student spent most of
                           her time establishing how various religious groups in Lebanon viewed each other and,
                           in relation to this, how to separate opinions from facts (since a lot of what is available
                           is biased information).

                        <p class="Tablebody">Overall, in the candidate’s assessment, the EE was very much worth it. The main future
                           application and benefit of having gone through said process is an awareness of managing
                           one’s time well by “getting a head start”, “spacing out time wisely” and “using any
                           spare time available”. This, too, is the advice she would pass on to future EE candidates:
                           “Get a head start during the summer, using any spare time available to you.” Her final
                           piece of advice: “Make your topic personal!”

                        about the depiction of women in society. I come from India and there has been a lot
                        of media attention recently on the treatment of women in our culture and society and
                        this is something that deeply concerns me. Every day the newspapers are full of headlines
                        on the topic of women and I would like to look at the perception of Indian women in
                        both the present and the past. My supervisor has advised me to discuss further with
                        the students from other cultures to get a clearer understanding of my research question.

                        <p class="Tablebody">As suggested by my supervisor I have spoken to many students from different backgrounds
                           and realize that gender discrimination is experienced around the world. I didn’t realize
                           this as I thought it was only really bad in India. This has made me more passionate
                           about this topic.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">From a personal reflection I experienced while in art class I noticed that depending
                           on how I am feeling I draw differently. If I am unhappy or feeling negative my drawings
                           will reflect this. This led me to think how emotion can relate to culture. I think
                           it is really interesting to observe this through artwork. Therefore, I have chosen
                           to research the depiction of women under the subject of visual arts and I have started
                           to interview students that study art and those that don’t to see how different the
                           perceptions are. The perceptions are really different, and many interviewees believe
                           that emotion plays a big part. After talking to my art teacher, I decided it would
                           be good to compare two artists and investigate how their emotional background and
                           culture influenced their depiction of women in their work. I have chosen to look at
                           the artists Chagall and Sorolla. My supervisor suggested I consider my sources as
                           I should not just rely on interviews.

                        time. I kept my initial idea of looking at the depiction of women but after lots of
                        discussions and reading on the internet my thoughts expanded. Interviewing people
                        as a technique confirmed my idea that emotion and culture are related but also made
                        me consider other perspectives that I had not thought about. My passion for the plight
                        of women intensified after speaking to other nationalities and I hope my essay can
                        help change perceptions. Studying the two artists gave me further evidence to back
                        my research and going through the process with my supervisor was really helpful in
                        making my thinking clear.

                           Carrying her research forward by studying the depiction of women in art, she realized
                           that gender abuse is universal. She hopes her essay will help change the people’s

                           she wanted to examine global emissions, but wasn’t sure how to tackle it. Initially,

                           this a daunting task … not only to find the information concerning their recognized
                           emissions and policies that help to govern them, but the ability to fit all this into
                           a 4,000-word essay. M worked diligently over the summer, contacting me once to give
                           an update. She attended a writing workshop intended to help students with the EE,
                           and this experience gave her a new direction and she was excited about this. She has
                           now seen the craziness of her previous idea and settled on something more reasonable,
                           the city comparison between Los Angeles and Beijing.

                     sessions with your supervisor: the first formal reflection session should focus on
                     your initial ideas and how you plan to undertake your research; the interim reflection
                     session is once a significant amount of your research has been completed; and the

                     in your EE. This document acts as a record in supporting the authenticity of your

                           as which areas of the body will be measured and what exercises will be done through
                           the course of the investigation. After advice from bodybuilders I will also factor
                           a two-day rest and recovery period each week so that the amino acids will be able

                        realize that my data is completely invalid as I only had a sample size of one. If
                        I had done this as a pilot study and then continued to increase the number of subjects,
                        then this would have produced much more effective data and improved my research. I
                        actually decided to experiment on myself because I was not sure about the ethical
                        guidelines. In addition to my personal investigation, researching the essential amino
                        acids leucine, lysine, valine, phenylalanine and methionine present in whey amino
                        acid consumption has given me a strong scientific background to my overall understanding
                        of the effectiveness of whey as a muscle-developing supplement. I would advise other
                        students who undertake the EE to be clear on their research question from the start
                        as it focused my investigation and allowed me the space to structure the essay with
                        room for adjustments to my plan.

                           in this topic and used himself as his investigative subject; this kept him engaged

                           however he also wanted to be sure the scientific content was rigorously upheld.

                           stage. He was a pleasure to work with and showed intelligence, independence and initiative

                        would allow me to explore broader concepts in my topic. I ultimately chose acupuncture
                        in the treatment of addiction because I knew I would enjoy this topic and be able
                        to write a good
                         EE on it. My first concerns included finding enough resources that relate to acupuncture
                        and addiction treatment. So I went away from the reflection session and looked in
                        various places—the library, internet, bookstores etc—and asked the librarian for help.

                        challenge I face now is deciding what information I do not need. I found myself writing
                        about things that interested me but did not relate to my paper. My supervisor suggested
                        I could solve this problem by prioritizing. One change that is needed is using a wider
                        range of resources. My main resources are print books and encyclopaedias. He thinks
                        it would be beneficial for me to look at online academic journals and articles as
                        they have another aspect that print books do not have.

                        on the subject. But not too much! I was able to “connect some dots” on my own and
                        still speculate on the potential drawbacks of acupuncture in addiction treatment.
                        I was a little surprised at how much I enjoyed my topic. I found very interesting
                        pieces of information that I will remember for the future.

                           she studied in her EE. She seemed overwhelmed at the beginning of the process, but
                           she was able to settle down and do lots of research on the topic. She met all internal
                           deadlines on time and she did not procrastinate. Although I do feel that some of the

                        and mathematics. I looked into how mathematical functions can generate patterns that
                        could be classified as art and I found that the topic of fractal geometry fits this
                        quite well. While researching fractals, I soon realized that there is a lot of maths
                        behind it all that cannot be explained in a theory of knowledge presentation and this
                        is why I decided I would revisit this topic and write my extended essay about fractals.
                        My supervisor suggested expanding my sources.

                           to reflect this: “What is the relationship between the Mandelbrot set and the Julia
                           set; and how can these sets be expressed mathematically?”

            Criterion E: engagement. This criterion assesses the student’s engagement with the

                        <p class="Tablebody">The candidate’s connection with her topic is of a rather personal nature: as a matter
                           of fact, one would be hard-pressed to identify an example that would hit closer to
                           home. The student is Lebanese and lived in Lebanon, raised by a Shia Muslim father
                           and Sunni mother.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">The EE process turned out to be a rewarding one, as it offered the candidate the unique
                           and invaluable opportunity to study and begin to understand a conflict that she was
                           aware of but not familiar with in terms of the historical significance of names, events
                           and places. By looking at the facts, the student discovered that the underlying cause
                           was religious factionalism.
                        </p>

                           laying the foundation and finding reliable historians. However, once started, and
                           after finding several good sources, everything moved forward smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">Another challenge involved time management and the writing and rewriting of the essay.
                           In general, the student spent most of her time establishing how various religious
                           groups in Lebanon viewed each other and, in relation to this, how to separate opinions
                           from facts.

                        <p class="Tablebody">Overall, in the candidate’s assessment, the EE process was very much worth it. Main
                           future application and benefit of having gone through said process is an awareness
                           of the importance of managing one’s time well by getting a head start and spacing
                           out time wisely. The candidate appreciated how the personal nature of the essay made
                           her motivated to want to write and research.

                           times to try to comprehend the processes they employed.

                        <p class="Tablebody">Through this approach, he has improved his use and understanding of scientific language

                           the essay.

                        <p class="Tablebody">I have worked with E over the last year leading up to the submission of her EE. Although
                           E was somewhat slow in producing written work, she was engaged intellectually in the
                           EE task.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">During the viva voce, E explained that she is passionate about visual arts but she
                           wanted to analyse more current and pervasive texts in her EE, which led her to advertisements.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">Further, she chose her focus on company X since it is a multinational company with
                           several brands around the world that she could analyse. She also explained that she
                           liked the fact that company X has leading brands in the US and in Brazil, as she planned
                           to analyse the use of language as well as images in the ads.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">E mentioned that she particularly enjoyed researching and analysing entire product
                           ads and campaigns, yet she felt the need to select representative ads to analyse more
                           carefully considering the scope of the EE. She also commented that she was surprised
                           to find that beer advertisements are so culturally oriented.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">She explained that the difficulties she encountered in the EE were mostly with the
                           writing process itself, as she struggles with writing generally. Thus, her advice
                           to other students is to spread out the EE writing, so that there is more time to write
                           and revise under less time pressure. Finally, E explained that she learned the value
                           of time management through the EE, since she did not always manage her time well and
                           she struggled to meet internal deadlines.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">E’s comments during the viva voce illustrated a fairly good degree of critical analysis
                           and depth of understanding of her research question.

         <h2>Overview of the WSEE</h2>
         <p>The WSEE invites students to conduct an in-depth, 
            <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> investigation into an issue of contemporary global importance (maximum 4,000 words).
         </p>
         <div class="chapter">

            <h2>Interdisciplinary approach</h2>
            <p>The perspective of just one subject may not be adequate to address complex issues
               like these. The WSEE therefore requires students to bring together aspects of different
               disciplines to illuminate their chosen topic.
            </p>
            <p>The IB recommends that the student uses two disciplines. These must be Diploma Programme
               subjects, one of which the student must be studying.
            </p>
            <p>Students are not expected to address the topic in its full complexity, but should
               aim to generate understandings that are new to them.

         </div>
         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>The aims of the WSEE are to enable students to:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>frame and understand complex contemporary world problems for in-depth study</li>
               <li>gather and synthesize insights from two different disciplines to better understand
                  the issue
               </li>
               <li>develop global consciousness—a disposition to recognize and understand local and global
                  relationships in dynamic interaction
               </li>
               <li>view themselves as interpreters of and actors in an increasingly interconnected world.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Focus</h2>
            <p>Students are encouraged to focus on just 
               <strong>one or two contexts</strong> in some depth, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>The student examines two geographical case studies to explore whether religious beliefs
                  affect attitudes towards HIV/AIDS in Oslo and Mombasa.
               </li>
               <li>The student examines one or two events to evaluate relief efforts after natural disasters,
                  and suggests ways to make these more responsive.
               </li>
               <li>The student examines one or two interventions to investigate what determines the success
                  or failure of sanctions imposed by the United Nations.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students can refer to other places and events beyond the primary context(s) when relevant
               to the argument. In fact, the IB encourages this as it displays global consciousness.
               However, a detailed contextualized study of these additional cases is impossible within
               the 4,000-word limit.

         <h2>Defining interdisciplinary study</h2>
         <p>In interdisciplinary study, students integrate knowledge and modes of thinking from
            two or more disciplines to gain a deeper understanding of an issue. Crucially, they
            would have been unable to gain this understanding if they only looked at the issue
            from the perspective of one of the disciplines.

            <h2>Interdisciplinary research</h2>
            <p>Interdisciplinary research in the IB is not “a-disciplinary” or “anti-disciplinary”.
               It draws rigorously on discipline-specific ways of knowing—established knowledge claims,
               methods, approaches to inquiry and forms of communication—to inform a new understanding.
            </p>
            <p>In conducting independent interdisciplinary research, students will:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>explore problems, ideas and issues from the perspective of two IB subject areas</li>
               <li>build the inquiry skills necessary for conducting rigorous and age-appropriate research</li>
               <li>exercise initiative in applying thinking skills critically and creatively to recognize,
                  frame and approach complex problems of global significance.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interdisciplinary research values the process of learning, as well as its results.
               The process involves students in:
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li>Identifying a topic of personal, local* and global significance.</li>
               <li>Framing a researchable question.</li>
               <li>Identifying the sources of expertise and disciplinary perspectives to further their
                  understanding of the topic.
               </li>
               <li>Gathering relevant information, ideas and tools in such disciplines.</li>
               <li>Defining a research approach or method.</li>
               <li>Synthesizing the different perspectives to advance their own interpretation or explanation
                  of, or solution to, the problem under study.
               </li>
               <li>Crafting the essay and reflecting on their work, its significance, limitations and
                  possibilities.
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Students begin the interdisciplinary research process with their initial beliefs about
               their chosen topics.
            </p>
            <p>As they gather findings, consider theories and make connections, they revise and enrich
               their initial views. Students capture the process of building their understanding
               in the RRS
               and the RPPF
              . They receive informative feedback from their supervisors, which in turn deepens
               their understanding.

               <h3>Level of understanding</h3>
               <p>Students are not expected to achieve comprehensive mastery of disciplines before their
                  interdisciplinary research. However, they are expected to demonstrate a deep understanding
                  of the particular theories, concepts or methods they use.
               </p>
               <p>There are multiple aspects of a discipline that can inform an interdisciplinary project:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>theories, conceptual frameworks, concepts or findings (eg from biology, history, mathematics

                  <li>distinct disciplinary methods, research instruments or approaches to inquiry</li>
                  <li>characteristic communicative styles, languages or symbol systems.</li>

               <p>By grounding their research in disciplines and established areas of expertise, students

                  methods and techniques to answer questions about the world.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Before they begin their research, ask students to use the lens of the biologist, the

                  answer to their question.

               <p class="NoteHeading1">Example: an investigation of villagers’ attitudes to water filtration</p>
               <p class="Notebody">Nira, a student in Mombasa, focused her essay on the adoption of new water sanitation
                  systems in a nearby rural village.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Following an outbreak of illnesses there, students in a creativity, action, service
                  (CAS) project tested the quality of tap and well water available to villagers. They
                  discovered a high concentration of bacteria in the water.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Nira devised and tested an inexpensive home-made microfiltration system better capable
                  of capturing pathogens in the water. When the villagers refused to adopt the new filter,
                  Nira sought to understand the values and beliefs that lay behind this refusal.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Nira’s essay drew on biology and anthropology.</p>
               <p class="Notebody">She defined water-borne pathogens and explained their impact on human health in areas
                  of poor water sanitation. She characterized the global scope of the problem by showing
                  that deaths from diarrhoeic diseases are typically concentrated in poorer areas without
                  sewage systems. Nira explained the mechanisms that make microfiltration preferable
                  to boiling the water or using regular filters.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Nira wanted to understand how the villagers usually filtered the tap and well water.
                  She collected information through interviews and questionnaires, as well as on-site
                  observation. Her goal was to understand how villagers made sense of water quality
                  and filtration processes and why they would prefer less reliable methods.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Taking an anthropologist’s perspective, Nira concluded that the villagers’ refusal
                  to use the new filter resulted from financial considerations rather than ignorance.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Through her research Nira came to view her interviewees as embedded in complex social
                  systems that placed important demands on them. Their spending priorities were education
                  for their children, house maintenance, clothing and food. Nira realized that, for
                  the villagers to adopt her filtration method, she would have to do more than simply
                  present the filter. For example, she would need an awareness programme to help the
                  villagers understand how getting sick through the existing methods cost them more
                  in the long run.

            <h2>Disciplinary knowledge and methodology</h2>
            <p>Experts within a discipline view their work as serving purposes that are often shared
               with a number of their peers. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>A biologist may seek to understand less than obvious factors affecting ecosystems
                  in order to protect biodiversity.
               </li>
               <li>A historian may study the Holocaust in order to understand the role of leaders in
                  the collapse of justice, while another may seek to shed light on cultural conditions.
                  Both may hope that the lessons learned will be useful.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disciplinary practices vary widely.</p>
            <p>For example, two biologists are investigating animal social cooperation. The experimental
               biologist studies fly populations in the laboratory. The environmental biologist tracks
               a family of orangutans in Uganda. Their methods to investigate animal social cooperation
               differ greatly, and their results and explanations may well do so, too.
            </p>
            <p>However, most importantly, both biologists’ perspectives are informed by disciplinary
               knowledge and methodology. Their disciplinary expertise sets their different views
               apart from unsubstantiated or naive opinion.
            </p>
            <p>It is very easy for students to rely on common-sense understanding of a global issue
               or more informal insights. However, the academic nature of the EE requires students
               to understand a global issue through disciplinary lenses.

               <p class="Notebody">
                  <strong>Disciplinary inquiry is purposeful</strong>
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">We seek to understand the past and enrich our sense of ourselves (in history).</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">We seek to explain, control and predict natural or social phenomena (in physics, biology,

               <p class="Notebody">
                  <strong>Targeted inquiries</strong> also serve specific purposes. Concepts and findings in one discipline are often applied
                  in another, novel context to solve problems, create products or explain phenomena.

               <p class="NoteHeading1">Questions to ask</p>
               <p class="Notebody">When students consider whether to include a specific discipline in the design of their
                  research, they can ask themselves:

                  <strong>Nira’s essay investigating villagers’ attitudes to water filtration</strong>
                  clearly illustrates the distinct purposes of biology and anthropology.
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">From a biologist’s perspective, Nira sought to explain the science of water-borne
                  pathogens and the effect of a microfiltering system.
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">From the perspective of a social and cultural anthropologist, she sought to understand
                  the villagers’ existing water sanitation practices as part of a larger set of commitments
                  shaping their lives. Most importantly, she wanted to understand how the villagers
                  made sense of these practices.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">In both cases, Nira’s own research purpose was well aligned with the purpose of inquiry
                  in these disciplines.

               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">We understand a biological phenomenon like genetic inheritance when we can articulate

               <p class="Notebody">In 
                  <strong>Nira’s</strong> essay investigating villagers’ attitudes to water filtration
                 , the Diploma Programme biology course informed her work by providing information
                  about water-borne human diseases. For example:

               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">the role of particular pathogens and bacteria in causing disease</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">data on the global distribution of such diseases.</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">concepts such as “potable water standards” that informed the research design.</p>
               <p class="Notebody">Social and cultural anthropology introduced Nira to the concepts of meaning-making,
                  social practices and complex social systems. Nira was then able to apply these to
                  her interpretation of the villagers’ views and behaviour.

               <p class="Notebody">Additional constructs like “modernization” and “urbanization” could have enabled her

            <h2>Selecting and evaluating disciplinary insights</h2>
            <p>Students need to look beyond a discipline’s content when exploring whether it will
               be useful to their essay. They should also reflect on these aspects:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>insights</li>
               <li>findings</li>
               <li>theories</li>
               <li>methods</li>
               <li>techniques</li>
               <li>approaches</li>
               <li>forms of communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students can use their RRS
               to examine disciplines and seek advice from their supervisors or experts in relevant
               fields.
            </p>
            <p>When students examine a rich topic they find that there are a number of disciplines
               that they could use as a basis for their study.
            </p>
            <p>With their supervisor’s guidance, students must learn to evaluate the contributions
               of each discipline and its particular theories, findings, methods or tools against
               one another. Most importantly, they must evaluate each discipline against their research
               goals.
            </p>
            <p>The evaluation of possible disciplinary insights should be a continual process.</p>

            <h2>Questions for students to ask</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>How might this particular disciplinary perspective inform my study?</li>
               <li>Is this theory helpful?</li>
               <li>Do I need to adjust my research question if I include this particular disciplinary
                  perspective?
               </li>
               <li>Among the possible useful disciplinary perspectives I am considering, which ones should
                  I exclude, so that I have a coherent approach to my essay and a manageable scope?
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 
               <strong>Nira’s essay investigating villagers’ attitudes to water filtration</strong>
              , she could have used other or additional disciplines to inform her study. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Economics could contribute an understanding of incentives and how they shape villagers’
                  behaviour.
               </li>
               <li>Geography’s search for patterns in human–environment interactions could offer information
                  about water sources in the region where the village is situated.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yet, for her study to succeed, Nira had to decide which disciplines to exclude. The
               best interdisciplinary projects select relevant disciplinary expertise to enable deep,
               complex understanding.

         <p>In interdisciplinary research, it is important to

            <h2>Why integration matters</h2>
            <p>Interdisciplinary research requires students to develop the capacity to make deep
               and productive connections across subjects. Building interdisciplinary understandings
               requires more than merely “making connections”. Rather, it demands that students recognize:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>what kinds of connections they need to pursue</li>
               <li>why such connections matter for the topic under study.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For students to make careful analyses and meaningful connections, they need to know:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>How exactly do disciplines come together in this research question/topic?</li>
               <li>In what ways does integrating disciplines contribute to a deeper, more nuanced and
                  complex understanding of the research question/topic?
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Successful integration of two or more subjects enables students to reach an understanding
               that they would not have achieved through single disciplinary means.
            </p>
            <p>(For this 4,000-word essay, it is recommended that no more than two subjects are utilized.)</p>
            <p>Focusing on integration involves being able to identify how, exactly, the concepts,
               methods, tools and genres of the disciplines combine productively. It invites students
               to ask important questions about what they learn and the subjects they engage with.

            <h2>How disciplines combine to produce a deeper understanding</h2>
            <p>Building integrative understandings invites students to make a variety of cross-disciplinary
               connections. One consideration is key:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Integration must advance understanding of the selected topic in desirable ways.</li>

            <p>Integrative understanding is most powerful when it clearly addresses the question
               posed by the interdisciplinary inquiry. In particular, integration of disciplines
               should enable the students to achieve the understanding framed within the chosen research
               topic.

         <p class="Notebody">In his essay about the causes of a malaria epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, Pière integrates
            biology and environmental systems and societies. He asks why malaria is so prevalent
            and unevenly distributed in this region.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">The essay explains not only how pathogens cause malaria in humans but also how a changing
            climate and rapid deforestation are creating conditions in which mosquitoes reproduce.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">While biology can explain the effects of the virus on humans, Pière needs environmental
            science to help shed light on the uneven distribution of the disease in the region.

         <p class="Notebody">Judy’s essay involves a critique of a historical monument commemorating the lives
            lost during the Rwanda genocide of 1994. Her paper offers an overview of the long-standing

            of such tension and the drastic decisions that led to the loss of nearly 800,000 lives.

         <p class="Notebody">Historical insights illuminate her interpretation of the aesthetic choices and symbolism
            employed in the monument, such as the use of a sand clock to mark the unprecedented

         <h2>Multiple forms of integration</h2>
         <p>There are multiple forms of integration, and one of the interesting qualities of interdisciplinary
            learning is that disciplines can be brought together in surprising and meaningful
            ways. Four examples of these are:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>complex explanation</li>
            <li>contextualization</li>
            <li>transdisciplinary exploration</li>
            <li>artistic synthesis</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Read the following descriptions of each type of integration. You will then be given
            four examples. Read them and decide which form of integration they represent.
         </p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Complex explanation</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Research questions often require you to understand why and how a complex event or
            phenomenon occurs. They may ask:
         </p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">“Why is the climate changing?”</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">“Why did individuals behave the way they did in the past?”</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">“Why is heart disease more prominent among some human populations than others?”</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Addressing questions like this requires you to draw on expertise stemming from more
            than one subject discipline. You can then integrate the insights from the different
            disciplines to give a “complex explanation”. Interdisciplinary explanations of this
            kind offer a more comprehensive account of the problem than single disciplinary ones.
         </p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Contextualization</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Contextualization is the placing of a particular concept or issue arising in one discipline
            in a larger historical, cultural or philosophical framework. Viewing the concept or
            issue in a different framework sheds new meaning on it.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">For example, we understand Gregor Mendel’s discovery of patterns of genetic inheritance
            or Pablo Picasso’s creation of 
            <em>Guernica</em> differently when historians place them in their historical context.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">Similarly, you can integrate disciplines in meaningful ways when you examine the historical,
            cultural or philosophical context of the topic you are studying.
         </p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Transdisciplinary exploration</p>
         <p class="Notebody">You explore 
            <strong>transdisciplinary concepts</strong> or 
            <strong>crossover tools</strong> when you apply a concept or skill typically found in two or more disciplines across
            subjects. For example:
         </p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">
            <strong>Careful observation</strong> is central to data collection in biology and life drawing in the arts.
         </p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">
            <strong>Evidence-based reasoning</strong> is central to both history and physics.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">When you compare and contrast the use of these and similar concepts/tools across disciplines,
            you understand them in a more nuanced way. Some disciplinary tools, such as statistical
            modelling or systems thinking, are particularly easily and usefully applied across
            domains.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">You show integrative understanding based on transdisciplinary concepts when:</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">you come to understand phenomena studied through the lens of multiple disciplines
            under a common conceptual frame (for example, systems theory), or
         </p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">you reach a better understanding of particular transdisciplinary concepts (evidence-based
            reasoning, careful observation) through comparing and contrasting their use in multiple
            disciplines.
         </p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Artistic synthesis</p>
         <p class="Notebody">You engage in an artistic synthesis when you examine an aesthetic interpretation of
            a non-artistic topic or issue. For example:
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">•	a historical monument commemorating the Second World War</p>
         <p class="Notebody">•	a poem interpreting climate change.</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Artistic synthesis deepens your understanding of a topic because you have to grapple
            with the issues in a new way. It requires you to:

         <p>The WSEE enables students to engage in an interdisciplinary examination of a topic
            of local and global significance. Students develop their understanding of their chosen
            topic by drawing on two Diploma Programme disciplines, one of which they must be studying
            already.
         </p>
         <p>A unique aspect of the WSEE is that it seeks to do more than simply help students

         <h2>What is global consciousness?</h2>
         <p>Throughout the decades, Diploma Programme teachers have sought to promote traits such
            as international-mindedness, intercultural understanding and global citizenship among
            their students.
         </p>
         <p>Multiple terms have been used in international education to refer to desirable qualities
            of mind and dispositions in a globally interdependent world:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Awareness</strong> denotes some knowledge and sensitivity to international or intercultural issues.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Perspective</strong> relates to global, national or cultural viewpoints.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>International</strong> or 
               <strong>intercultural understanding</strong> refers to students’ understanding of the relationships between nations or cultures.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>International-mindedness</strong> describes a disposition of openness and curiosity about the world and deep understanding
               of the complexity and diversity of human interactions.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Terms such as 
            <strong>international</strong> or 
            <strong>intercultural</strong> have been associated with specific countries, nation states and groups of people
            with particular sets of values and experiences. The term 
            <strong>global</strong> has been associated with views of the world as a whole or processes that impact upon
            the whole planet.
         </p>
         <p>In the definition of 
            <strong>global consciousness</strong> proposed here, 
            <strong>global</strong> refers explicitly to local–global dynamics. These dynamics are not limited to a uniform
            view of the whole world. Instead, they emphasize local–global developments and the
            global contexts in which they take place.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>Global consciousness</strong> is the capacity and disposition to understand and act upon issues of global significance.
            It is the ability and willingness to understand oneself and others within the broader
            matrix of our contemporary world.

         <h2>Global consciousness—a student portrait</h2>
         <p>Global consciousness is an elusive concept, which makes it difficult for teachers
            to identify shared markers or indicators. It does not refer to a body of knowledge
            that students need to master. It speaks of more perennial qualities of mind and heart—dispositions
            or elements of character.
         </p>
         <p>To make qualities of global consciousness visible we turn to a student portrait.</p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Sahdal: Portrait of a globally conscious student</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Sahdal is a 12th grade student in Mombasa, Kenya. His WSEE focused on the relationship
            between people’s religious affiliation and their level of understanding of HIV/AIDS.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">His interest in the topic developed in a biology class where students examined the
            structure of the virus and its effect in the body, and mapped the spread of the disease
            in Africa and worldwide.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">For his study he collected and compared data on attitudes and knowledge about HIV/AIDS
            among young people, adults and leaders in the local Christian, Muslim and Hindu communities.
         </p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Global sensitivity</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Sahdal was upset to learn about the global magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and
            its uneven distribution around the world. He had heard about it in the news before,
            but had not realized how tragic the problem was, especially within poorer countries.
            Learning about HIV/AIDS increased his 
            <strong>alertness</strong> to the problem.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">He was also surprised to learn that he and his friends had a few misconceptions about
            the disease and its transmission. Increasingly he noticed how often the topic appeared
            in the news and brought clips to class. He came to recognize that the cases of HIV
            he learned about were not isolated events but part of a larger regional epidemic.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">Sahdal also noticed that many of his peers did not want to talk much about the disease.
            Parents were not bringing the topic up and religious leaders seemed worried to do
            so as well. Recognizing the tension between his peers’ silence and the need to be
            informed, he focused his essay on the relationship between religious affiliation and
            understanding of HIV/AIDS. He explains:
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">
            <strong>
               <em>HIV/AIDS is still spreading and many people are getting affected and dying—especially
                  in sub-Saharan Africa. Because there is not a cure for it, it is important that young
                  people are aware. In order to educate them we need to know their level of awareness.
               </em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">
            <strong>
               <em>In Mombasa, tradition and religious morals are highly regarded. Because religious
                  leaders can be narrow-minded it is important to see whether these leaders limit or
                  promote awareness.
               </em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">In summary, how does Sahdal exhibit 
            <strong>global sensitivity</strong>? He becomes more alert to the problem in its local and global dimensions, finding
            opportunities to apply outside the classroom what he learns in class. He is more attentive
            to media and community accounts of cases of the disease and brings up the topic among
            his friends at school and in his 
            <em>madrasah</em> (religious school).
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">Recognizing that religious affiliations influence individual behaviour the world over,
            Sahdal points to the particularly religious culture in Mombasa where multiple traditions
            coexist.
         </p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Global understanding</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Sahdal understands HIV/AIDS as both a scientific and a social phenomenon. He can explain
            how the virus causes AIDS, its structure and the kinds of cells it targets. He also
            understands popular beliefs and misconceptions about the disease and how religion
            and school control access to information.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">Yet to exhibit a 
            <strong>global</strong> understanding Sahdal must examine the relationship between the local and the global.
            How do perceptions of HIV/AIDS in his local city of Mombasa relate to the broader
            challenge of informing people around the world?
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">The beginning of Sahdal’s essay includes global statistics on HIV/AIDS worldwide and
            compares them to regional and local indicators. This sets a global stage for his local
            study.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">He has important opportunities to examine the global dimension of his study as the
            paper unfolds. For example, Sahdal could examine how the three major world religions
            portray matters of health and lifestyle. He could also examine public national campaigns
            led by governments such as Uganda and Brazil.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">In conclusion, Sahdal exhibits 
            <strong>global understanding</strong> in his capacity:
         </p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to frame a global epidemic in local terms</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to consider the perspectives of members of diverse religious traditions.</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Opportunities to further Sahdal’s global understanding include helping him:</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to move flexibly across local, national and global dimensions of HIV/AIDS</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to ground his interpretation of religious perspectives in their fundamental principles.</p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Global self</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Sahdal’s engagement with the topic of HIV/AIDS does not stop at understanding the
            problem. He believes that there are things he can do to ameliorate the situation—particularly
            in his own Muslim community.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">
            <strong>
               <em>If I go and have HIV awareness sessions in my community madrasah (my religious school),
                  I can make a difference. I am just now planning sessions and awareness campaigns in
                  my community madrasah.
               </em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">Participating, and viewing himself as an active member of local and global communities,
            is a defining quality of Sahdal’s world view.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">In his diagram below, Sahdal identifies topics of global concern with ease—for example,
            global warming, deforestation and destruction of animal habitats; religious intolerance
            and violation of human rights; and lack of resources, droughts and famine.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">Most interestingly, he spontaneously notes his personal connections to each and describes
            a variety of actions in which he is engaged to ameliorate the problems. Actions include
            being a member of the school environment club for five years, volunteering at the
            local humane society and working in a local charity.

         <p>In the centre is me (the base). The first rows comprise personal ideas and activities,
            which are why I thought of the issues. The other rows are the issues raised.
         </p>
         <p>Sahdal exhibits a 
            <strong>global self</strong> in that he visibly views himself as being affected by global phenomena. He views
            his local actions as contributing to larger global developments. He is thoughtful
            about the extent and limitations of his contribution. For instance, he explains:
         </p>
         <p class="Quote">The problem that worries me the most is religious extremism and intolerance. Every
            day we hear about "suicide bombings", "Islamic militias", "Mujahedeen" and many innocent
            people die from these attacks. I am concerned because the concept of extremism, which
            some Muslims connect with religion, has no part with religion. This is something I
            notice often and talk with my friends about. I, as a Muslim, suffer from discrimination
            because of these views and in addition many people die. I am not doing much to make
            a difference in this area. Maybe because where I live there is not much extremism,
            trying to do something would not matter that much. However, if I decided to join activism
            for peace, I would make more of a difference. Nowadays I feel sympathy and feel that
            all I can do is pray, and that’s what I do.
         </p>
         <p>Sahdal’s portrait offers a window into the mind of a globally conscious student. It
            shows that, to be globally conscious, students must:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <strong>have information about the world</strong>
            </li>
            <li>exhibit a distinctive 
               <strong>way of being in the world</strong>—
            </li>
            <li>be attentive to the ways in which global phenomena are manifested in local realities,
               as well as their own and others’ realities
            </li>
            <li>be reflective about their own roles as participants in local, national and global
               contexts.
            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>Clearly students will exhibit global consciousness in very different ways. Sahdal
            positions himself within issues and actions he deems important. Others may do so according
            to the places where they have lived or influential people in their lives.
         </p>
         <p>Regardless of these differences, students exhibit global consciousness when:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>they are attentive to issues of global significance around them</li>
            <li>they understand such issues in depth</li>
            <li>they can place themselves as thinkers and actors in today’s complex and interdependent
               world.
            </li>
         </ul>

                     would affect most people in the world. Being an economics student and working with
                     the NGO, I was curious to know how the economic crises of big cities could affect
                     a small NGO operating in rural India. My love for economics made me think about the
                     effect of the recession as a relatively disconnected area. Curiosity kicked in and
                     I decided to do it as my extended essay.

         <h2>Nurturing global consciousness</h2>
         <p>Supervisors working with students on their WSEE enjoy a unique opportunity to:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>support students’ interdisciplinary research</li>
            <li>engage in reflections about what it means to be an internationally minded or globally
               conscious person.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>The IB expects that, during advisory sessions and through informal conversations,
            supervisors will encourage students to:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>be aware of opportunities to connect what they are learning with local and global
               developments around them (global sensitivity)
            </li>
            <li>reflect about their own values, thoughts, commitments, concerns and possible actions
               with regard to the topics they study
            </li>
            <li>make meaningful connections between their personal lives and the issues under study

            </li>
         </ul>
         <img src="**insert link url**" alt="**insert alt text**"></img>
         <p>Through their exchanges with students, supervisors will gain a better sense of their
            students’ unfolding global consciousness. Supervisors are requested to comment on
            this aspect of student development on the extended RPPF
           .
         </p>
         <p>For example, teachers may characterize a student’s global consciousness considering
            the indicators above. They can provide evidence by describing:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>a pivotal learning moment</li>
            <li>the students’ discovery of self</li>
            <li>observation of the students’ spontaneous engagement with the topic outside of school</li>
            <li>a reflection on how the students have enriched their self-portraits as their project
               unfolded.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Supervisors' observations, and their supporting evidence, directly inform examiners
            when they assess the essay against criterion E: engagement.
         </p>
         <p class="NoteHeading1">Important note on supervising a WSEE</p>
         <p class="Notebody">Students undertaking a WSEE should be allocated one supervisor, like other EE students.</p>
         <p class="Notebody">This may be:</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">someone who is interested in the issue the student is exploring, or</p>
         <p class="Notelist(bullet)">a teacher of one of the Diploma Programme disciplines the student is using as part
            of their interdisciplinary approach.
         </p>
         <p class="Notebody">It is not necessary for students to be allocated two supervisors.</p>
         <p class="Notebody">For example, if a student is undertaking a WSEE using biology and economics, the biology
            teacher may act as the supervisor. The student can also interview an economics teacher
            about their chosen topic, but the economics teacher is an expert resource, not a supervisor.

               <p>Supervisors can set clear expectations about students’ development as internationally

                  students early in the process and develop a joint plan for support.

                  <ul>
                     <li>showing respect for students’ interests</li>

               </div>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Social environments</h4>
                  <p>Supervisors can consider the social environments in which students are most likely
                     to grow as global citizens. For example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>related CAS projects</li>
                     <li>afterschool study groups</li>
                     <li>student-run seminars.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These can all provide a meaningful social structure and productive environments for
                     individual and group reflection about topics of global significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>The task of teaching students about the world contrasts with nurturing global consciousness.
                     The latter speaks to a more deeply owned set of dispositions and outlooks on world
                     and self.
                  </p>
                  <p>Global consciousness is thus best nurtured through a combination of:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the teaching and learning that students are exposed to as part of their Diploma Programme
                        education
                     </li>
                     <li>the tacit curriculum embedded in the school culture.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Students are most likely to develop global consciousness when they live in school
                     environments in which they “breathe” international-mindedness. In such schools, factors
                     like the ones listed above converge in creating rich environments for local and global
                     reflection and action.
                  </p>
                  <p>Students are encouraged to dedicate thoughtful time to the study of issues of global
                     significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>The school can offer students plenty of opportunities to examine global and local
                     topics in depth and express their views through, for example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>exhibitions</li>
                     <li>CAS initiatives</li>
                     <li>essay competitions</li>
                     <li>student newspapers.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The school also provides visible models of globally conscious behaviours, values and
                     life commitments. For example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>speakers</li>
                     <li>events</li>
                     <li>class projects.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Attending to local and global news, and reflecting on roles and positions, becomes
                     routine and part of social interactions and institutionalized structures through,
                     for example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>study groups</li>
                     <li>fairs</li>
                     <li>teachers’ meetings</li>
                     <li>school assemblies</li>
                     <li>student portfolio reviews.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Above all, teachers, students, parents and administrators in schools that aspire to
                     create a culture of global consciousness face the task of creating intellectually
                     engaging, ethically committed and trusting learning environments in which the world
                     around us becomes not only the context but also the content of a meaningful education.

         <h2>Understanding the assessment criteria</h2>
         <p>It is important that supervisors and students understand the assessment criteria and
            how these are applied by examiners to an EE.
         </p>
         <p>The EE is an externally assessed component of the Diploma Programme, marked by an
            IB examiner. Examiners are unaware of any predicted grade that a supervisor gives
            to the essay. The examiners simply apply the assessment criteria based on the evidence
            in front of them—the student’s work.
         </p>
         <p>It is important, therefore, that a students’ demonstration of the assessment criteria
            is clear and apparent.
         </p>
         <p>Supervisors and coordinators must ensure that students understand from the outset
            how they are to be assessed.
         </p>
         <p>For details of the assessment criteria please refer to the following sections of this
            site:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Assessment of the extended essay

            <li>Unpacking the criteria
              
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>It is also useful to understand how the assessment criteria are considered holistically
            across the whole essay. The following table gives some examples:
         </p>
         <table>
            <tr>

            <p>Each criterion is organized at three levels of information. Firstly, the

                 <strong>Overview</strong>
              </p>
              <p>An extended essay (EE) in studies in language and literature gives students an opportunity
                 to undertake independent research into a topic of special interest to them within
                 the subject. It is intended to promote advanced research and writing skills, intellectual
                 discovery and creativity.
              </p>
              <p>The essay is open to students who are writing in a language which they would be capable
                 of offering as 
                 <hi class="color(9BBB59)">a Language A [link to definition of Lang A]</hi>. 
              </p>
              <p>It must be written in the language for which it is registered. </p>
              <p>Students must 
                 <strong>not</strong> submit a 
                 <hi class="color(9BBB59)">Group 1</hi> EE in their 
                 <hi class="color(9BBB59)">Group 2</hi> [link to explanation] language.
              </p>
              <p>Studies in language and literature EEs are divided into three categories: </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>Category 1</strong>	Studies of one or more literary works originally written in the language in which
                 the essay is presented 
              </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>Category 2</strong>	Studies of a literary work or works originally written in the language of the essay
                 compared with one or more literary works originally written in another language. (The
                 work originally written in another language may be studied in translation.)
              </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>Category 3</strong>	Studies in language based on one or more texts originally produced in the language
                 in which the essay is presented.
              </p>
              <p>Students and teachers must indicate at the point of upload which category of essay
                 they are submitting, for example, English A Cat: 2; German A Cat : 3; Spanish A Cat
                 : 1.
              </p>
              <p class="heading4">Categories 1 and 2</p>
              <p>An EE in categories 1 and 2 gives students an opportunity to:</p>
              <ul>
                 <li>study in depth a literary topic </li>
                 <li>engage in independent literary criticism</li>
                 <li>engage with established critical comment (where appropriate)</li>
                 <li>develop the ability to put forward their views persuasively and in a well-structured
                    manner, using a register appropriate to the study of literature.
                 </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Students must place their analysis of their chosen text(s) in the wider context of
                 the discipline.  This may include other literary texts, or particular critical perspectives
                 or insights.  However, this wider discussion should not detract from the main focus
                 of their chosen text(s).
              </p>
              <p class="heading4">Category 3</p>
              <p>A category 3 studies in language and literature EE gives students the opportunity
                 to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                 <li>demonstrate skills of textual analysis by considering how language, culture, and/or
                    context influence the ways in which meaning is constructed in texts
                 </li>
                 <li>examine critically the different relationships and interactions which exist between
                    texts, audiences, and purposes
                 </li>
                 <li>engage with established (or developing) critical writing, as appropriate</li>
                 <li>develop the ability to put forward their views persuasively and in a well-structured
                    manner, using a register and terminology appropriate to the subject.
                 </li>

                 <h2>Choice of topic </h2>
                 <p>Their EE may relate to work they have already completed during the course but students
                    must also demonstrate relevant wider reading and individual study.

                 <p>It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that the topic of their extended
                    essay does not overlap with any other work they are preparing for assessment in Language
                    A - for example, the Written Assignment in the Literature course, or the Written Task
                    in the Language and Literature course. Students risk their Diploma if academic misconduct
                    is detected.

            <p>This TSM has been written by IB teachers experienced in supporting students and fellow
               teachers through the EE component of the Diploma Programme.
            </p>
            <p>Its advice is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive, but is designed to:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>support both experienced and less experienced EE coordinators and supervisors (experienced
                  coordinators and supervisors will find it helpful to view “What’s new in EE from 2016”

            <h2>Contents</h2>
            <p>The material consists of background information and resources for EE coordinators
               and supervisors. Some of the resources are also for students. The TSM is divided into
               four sections. The third section provides specific support for the world studies extended
               essay (WSEE)—although there may be aspects that are useful for supervisors and students
               of disciplinary essays. All other sections apply to all EEs, including that for world
               studies.

            <p>This TSM builds on research and practice and is designed to help coordinators and
               supervisors guide student learning. You are encouraged to read the various sections
               before you embark on supervision. You should then revisit particular sections as needed.
               Selected sections will be useful in terms of collaborative planning, particularly
               those in relation to the implementation of the EE process, supervision and reflection
               sessions.

            <h2>Students and the teacher support material</h2>
            <p>It is the supervisor’s role to judge the particular needs of students at specific
               moments in the research process. It is intended that some sections of this TSM be
               shared with students during supervision sessions, as deemed appropriate. However,
               the materials provided here are not intended to replace the supervisor’s role and
               should not be shared with students in full. When using any of the materials with students,
               you will need to discuss with them how these will inform their research.

            <h2>The EE at a glance</h2>
            <p>The EE is the centrepiece of the IB Diploma Programme. It is an integral and valuable
               learning experience for all Diploma Programme students, or an option for course students.
            </p>
            <p>The 
               <strong>aims</strong> of the EE are for students to:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>engage in independent research with intellectual initiative and rigour</li>
               <li>develop research, thinking, self-management and communication skills</li>
               <li>reflect on what has been learned throughout the research and writing process.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Choice of topic</h3>
               <p>The EE is an in-depth study of a focused topic. Students choose their topic from the
                  list of available Diploma Programme subjects for the session in question. For those
                  taking the IB diploma, this is normally one of the student’s six chosen subjects.
                  It may also be a subject that a course candidate has a background in.

            <div class="section">
               <h3>Skills—research, writing, reflection</h3>
               <p>The EE gives students the opportunity to research a topic of their own choice, under
                  the guidance of a supervisor
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>.
               </p>
               <p>Students then undertake a major piece of formally presented, structured writing. They
                  communicate their ideas and findings in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate
                  to the subject chosen.
               </p>
               <p>All students are required to undertake three reflection sessions with their supervisor.
                  The third is a short, concluding interview, or viva voce, following the completion
                  of the essay.

                     students.
                  </li>
                  <li>A student must achieve a D grade or higher for the EE to be awarded the Diploma.</li>
                  <li>The EE is externally assessed. Together with the grade for theory of knowledge, it
                     contributes up to three points to the total score for the Diploma.
                  </li>
                  <li>The EE process helps prepare students for university and other pathways beyond the
                     Diploma Programme.
                  </li>
                  <li>Students must choose a subject for their essay from the list of Diploma Programme

                  </li>
                  <li>The EE is a piece of independent research on a topic chosen by the student in consultation
                     with a supervisor in the school.
                  </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>It is the result of approximately 40 hours of work by the student.</li>
                  <li>Students are supported by a supervision process recommended to last three to five

               <p>Students’ involvement in CAS (creativity, activity, service) activities often inspires
                  their EE. Students are motivated by an interest that has developed outside of the

                  aspects of their learning.
               </p>
               <p>The personal and local context can enhance students’ learning. It can also help them
                  develop additional learner profile attributes as their research may, for example,
                  then lead to further community action.

                  <p>This essay offers students the opportunity to make an in-depth, interdisciplinary
                     study of an issue of contemporary global significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>Students can choose to explore a topic under one of the following global themes:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>conflict, peace and security</li>

                  <p>This fits nicely with one of the goals of the WSEE: to advance students’ global consciousness.
                     Through CAS, students can be exposed to a particular global issue as manifested at
                     their local level. The students can then further their understanding of the issue
                     through academic research and writing the EE.

                  <p>This may in turn lead to a more considered involvement in CAS, and to further service

            <h2>The EE and TOK</h2>
            <p>The EE and the theory of knowledge (TOK) course are both concerned with interpreting
               and evaluating evidence, and constructing reasoned arguments.
            </p>
            <p>Where the two differ is in the emphasis placed on the research process and its formal
               outcomes. These aspects are of primary importance in the EE but less so in the theory
               of knowledge essay.

               <h3>Reflection</h3>
               <p>Both TOK and the EE promote reflection on the nature of knowledge and on how new knowledge
                  is produced.
               </p>
               <p>The EE also requires students to reflect on the research process, in terms of the
                  skills they acquire and develop.

               <p>During their EE research, students engage with different sources of information and
                  are exposed to new perspectives on issues. They are required to think all of this
                  through in an analytical and evaluative way.

               <p>The EE process—from selecting a topic through to submitting the completed essay—should
                  take four to eight months. Within that period, the student should spend approximately
                  40 hours on the task. If the time frame is too long, students risk losing their momentum
                  and direction, and if it is too short, they may not have sufficient time to fully
                  explore their topic and develop the requisite skills. The model adopted will vary
                  according to school context.

            <div class="section">
               <h3>The role of the supervisor</h3>
               <p>Students and schools should work together to find an appropriately qualified supervisor
                  from the school for each student. It is advisable that supervisors are familiar with
                  the specific discipline involved, or more generally with the problem or issue under
                  study.
               </p>
               <p>The primary responsibility for the essay lies with the student, but the supervisor
                  mentors the student through each stage of the process.
               </p>
               <p>A good student–topic–supervisor fit is likely when the supervisor:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>knows the student well</li>
                  <li>shares the student’s excitement and curiosity about the topic</li>
                  <li>is comfortable establishing a clear work plan with the student</li>
                  <li>follows up with timely feedback.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The supervisor should:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>mentor the student with advice on the skills of undertaking the research process
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
                  <li>encourage and support the student throughout the research and writing of the EE
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
                  <li>guide the student in formulating a well-focused research question that satisfies appropriate
                     legal and ethical standards
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>

               <p>The supervisor is 
                  <strong>not</strong> responsible for verifying specific content within the students’ EE. The supervisor
                  
                  <strong>is</strong> responsible for verifying that the essay is the students’ own work and that the students
                  have properly acknowledged all their sources.

               <h3>Meetings</h3>
               <p>The following supervision model has three stages and includes six targeted meetings:</p>

                  <li>three 
                     <strong>mandatory reflection sessions</strong> recorded on the RPPF

                  <li>three 
                     <strong>check-in sessions</strong> that involve both student and supervisor input.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>However, some students may require more check-in sessions.</p>
               <p>The supervisor uses each session to guide the student at key moments in the EE process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Preparation</h3>
               <p>It is vital that the student and supervisor are well prepared for each session. For
                  example, the student may need to send some materials to the supervisor in advance
                  (such as parts of the essay, or excerpts from the RRS). At stage three, students must
                  submit their full draft to the supervisor in good time for them to read and provide
                  feedback to the student.

            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Timing</h3>
               <p>In the model below, the first three sessions take place quite close together (possibly
                  within one month) as they are important in establishing the preliminaries for the
                  essay. This work provides the essential preparation for the first reflection session.
               </p>
               <p>After this session, the student should clarify the research question to guide their
                  inquiry in preparation for the interim reflection session.
               </p>
               <p>At this point, there will likely be a period from one to three months (eg a long vacation)
                  while the student is building the body of the essay, culminating in a completed draft
                  to be ready for the third check-in session.
               </p>
               <p>There is likely to be over a month between the third check-in session and the final

            <h2>Contracting</h2>
            <p>Contracting is the process of reaching agreement between supervisor and student about
               how they will work together and their expectations of each other. It is the basis
               of their understanding of their working relationship for the duration of the student’s
               EE process.
            </p>
            <p>Each student works in a different way and the supervisor first needs to find out how
               a particular student learns and thinks. Then they will be able to choose together
               the most appropriate forms of support for that student.
            </p>
            <p>This section offers three teaching ideas for establishing a good working relationship
               between supervisor and student:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>the shield
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
               </li>
               <li>great expectations
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
               </li>
               <li>the lotus
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>The shield</h3>
               <p>This might be a pre-drawn shield divided into four or the supervisor can simply ask
                  the student to divide a page into four. Each part is given a heading:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Who I am</li>
                  <li>My passions and interests</li>
                  <li>Me as a learner</li>
                  <li>What I find challenging.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The student writes under each heading. This is used as a starting point to give the
                  supervisor an understanding of the student and so guide their relationship.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Great expectations</h3>
               <p>Both the student and the supervisor write a list of:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>what they expect from each other</li>
                  <li>how they want to work</li>
                  <li>practicalities (number of meetings, length of meetings).</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Each shares their list with the other and together they draw up a list of the guidelines
                  to guide their processes and meetings. It is also important to discuss how the meetings
                  will be run and for the supervisor to clearly state how to give feedback in different
                  ways. It is therefore important to establish how this will work for each individual
                  student to make sure any feedback or evaluation is constructive and achieves its purpose.

            <div class="section">
               <h3>The lotus</h3>
               <p>This is an exercise that can be used to generate ideas. It works on a “blossoming”
                  principle. The students draw a box in the centre of the page and write their area
                  of inquiry inside it. They then draw four diagonal lines from each of the four corners
                  of the square and draw a square at the end of each line. This creates a central box
                  surrounded by four smaller boxes. They write aspects related to their area of inquiry
                  in each of the four smaller boxes.
               </p>
               <p>They then draw four diagonal lines from each of the four corners of the four smaller
                  squares and draw a square at the end of each line. They write aspects for each of
                  the areas they have identified in the smaller boxes. This creates a central box surrounded
                  by four smaller boxes, each surrounded in turn by four more small boxes. This exercise
                  gives students the opportunity to identify key ideas and the various aspects that
                  need to be examined.
               </p>
               <p>It provides a good starting point for the supervisor and the student to discuss the
                  nature of the EE and the various aspects the student needs to explore.

            <h2>Questioning</h2>
            <p>The supervisor can help the students reflect by careful questioning:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>basic questioning: “Why did you do that?”</li>
               <li>academic: “How might you explain this?”</li>
               <li>personal: “How are you getting on?”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Questions that help student reflection can be divided into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Patterning questions: </strong>questions that connect knowledge and understanding in order to generate new insights
                  and perspectives.
               </li>
               <li>“What is the relationship between architecture and politics?”</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Dynamic questions: </strong>“how” questions that are related to action and process.
               </li>
               <li>“How will I make this model of a structure stand without support?”</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Speculative questions: </strong>questions that look at the possibilities and encourage creativity using “if” as key
                  wording in the question.
               </li>
               <li>“What if we build underwater?”</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Evaluative questions: </strong>questions that measure the extent to which something has been achieved or has been
                  successful against predetermined criteria and goals.
               </li>
               <li>“To what extent is an underwater structure safe?”</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Affective questions: </strong>questions that have a pastoral motivation and are designed to check the students’
                  well-being, progress and feelings about their learning and progress.
               </li>

               <p>The point at which students believe they’ve got near to a solution is the very point
                  when they should be asking more complex questions. This will lead them not just to
                  the solution but beyond it, producing original and innovative approaches to the area
                  of inquiry. It is the supervisor’s role to help them achieve this.

            <h2>Feedback and evaluation</h2>
            <p>Evaluation, including self-evaluation, is another distancing
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi> technique.
            </p>
            <p>It requires the students to look at something (be it their own work or that of another)
               from a distance and to judge it. This judgment of what has been produced and how,
               what has worked and what hasn’t, is measured against pre-set objectives and criteria.
            </p>
            <p>Evaluation may take place at certain points 
               <strong>during</strong> the development of the EE as well as at the 
               <strong>end</strong> of it.
            </p>
            <p>But evaluative reflection and feedback should always be 
               <strong>future-</strong>oriented. They should be formulated in terms of “So what?”, “What impact?”, “What
               next?” and “How next time?”
            </p>
            <p>What to do with feedback, and how to use it, is a key feature of learning through
               reflection. However, feedback has to be managed carefully. Its timing and how it “lands”
               are important things to consider.

               <h3>SAFE framework for feedback</h3>
               <p>The SAFE framework categorizes feedback into four types and is a useful guide for
                  supervisors.
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Share: </strong>This is primarily an exercise in sharing work and ideas. It is judgment-free and is
                     designed to affirm as well as develop the students’ work. The supervisor’s role is
                     to examine the students’ work and to share their ideas and suggestions. There is a
                     sense of collaboration and of trying to solve a problem together.

               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Affirm: </strong>This is a response designed to confirm success and achievements, responding to what
                     students have done so far, why and its impact. It is important for students to feel
                     they are making progress and affirmation is particularly useful during the “dips”
                     in the process. Sometimes this is all students need to move them on.

                  <li>
                     <strong>Feedback: </strong>General feedback helps students to develop their work and to overcome particular problems
                     and obstacles. It focuses on what they have and haven’t done as well as how they have
                     done it. It examines difficulties as well as possibilities and asks students to reflect
                     on their own approaches and progress.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  <em>Timing: mid project</em>
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Evaluate: </strong>This is a measure of the students’ success in achieving goals, answering questions
                     and developing skills. It is based on the students’ work, their original objectives
                     and criteria for success and a discussion about how this evaluation will affect their
                     future work.

               </p>
               <p>The SAFE approach requires the supervisor and the student to decide together which
                  type of response is most appropriate at any given time. Negotiating what type of response
                  would be most useful can be very helpful, with some provisos.

               <p class="Notebody">It requires the students to mark a moment as a milestone of what they have achieved
                  but to also reflect on the impact of this milestone on their learning and on them
                  as a person. What is the impact of this on their future work, learning, methodology
                  and actions?
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Ask the students to draw a railway line (a vertical line divided by at least five
                  shorter horizontal lines). The railway line should divide the page in half.

               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">For each horizontal line on the left-hand side, the students then identify breakthroughs,
                  key moments, challenges (and how they were overcome) and triumphs regarding the work
                  they have completed.
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">On the right-hand side, corresponding to each contribution on the left-hand side,
                  the students record how this will affect their future actions, methodologies and/or

               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">This allows what has been achieved to influence future approaches and actions.</p>
               <p class="NoteHeading1">Memorandum</p>
               <p class="Notebody">What we learn about ourselves during one piece of work can be elusive and easily forgotten
                  unless it is documented. This is an opportunity for the students to write a list of
                  “should” and “should not” to guide their future work.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Ask the students to record five of each. This can also form the basis of the students’
                  self-evaluation.

            <h2>External mentors and the EE</h2>
            <p>The IB expects that students will undertake the research for their EE and be supervised
               by a member of staff within the school.
            </p>
            <p>However, there may be cases when students undertake part of their research outside
               their school—for example, at a university or other local institution. This should
               only be in rare circumstances and with explicit permission from the DP/EE coordinator.
            </p>
            <p>These students must still be allocated a supervisor within the school, who will complete
               the reflection sessions and comment on and sign the RPPF.
            </p>
            <p>It is the school’s responsibility to ensure that external mentors understand and are
               clear about the parameters of the guidance they can give.
            </p>
            <p>External mentors are required to sign a copy of the formal letter included in the
               
               <em>Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme</em>
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>. This must be given to the external mentor at the start of the process.
            </p>
            <p>The external mentor will also need to electronically sign, date and provide comments
               at the end of the mentoring role.
            </p>
            <p>The letter must be physically inserted in the appendix of the essay as part of the
               student’s EE document file rather than included as a scanned document.
            </p>
            <p>If a student has had an external mentor, this signed letter is an important part of
               the authentication of the essay.

            <p>Students will need help in deciding on their EE topic and question.</p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Subject area and topic</h3>
               <p>Students should first decide which subject area they are interested in and read the
                  relevant subject-specific section of the 
                  <em>Extended essay guide</em>
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>.
               </p>
               <p>Each EE must be registered under a particular subject area. If students decide on
                  a topic without considering the subject, their essay may not fulfil the requirements
                  for the area under which it is eventually registered.
               </p>
               <p>An essay that is considered to be inappropriately registered will be compromised across
                  the assessment criteria.
               </p>
               <p>Students, with their supervisor’s help, must ensure they understand the requirements
                  for the subject under which they are registering their essay. Students should not
                  attempt to retrospectively fit an essay into a subject area once they have researched
                  and written it.

            <h2>Research within the EE—an overview</h2>
            <p>In order to conduct their research, students must first formulate a concise research
               question for inquiry. This starts out as a “working” research question that they can
               refine as they gather more information during their research.
            </p>
            <p>This section gives an overview of the research process—inquiry, action and reflection
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>—and suggests some online resources
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to research methods, but should provide
               some guidance as well as stimulation for seeking additional information and support.

            <div class="section">
               <h3>The research process</h3>
               <p>There are three stages in the research process: inquiry, action and reflection.</p>
               <img src="**insert link url**" alt="**insert alt text**"></img>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Stage 1: Inquiry</h4>
                  <p>During this stage, students collect information from a range of sources to help formulate
                     the research question. This may involve talking to people as well as reading.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As part of their inquiry, students should try to read as much as they can of what
                     has already been written about their topic. This is called a “literature review” or
                     “secondary research” (as opposed to carrying out their own “primary” research).
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondary sources may include:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>printed works—books, journals, newspapers, magazines</li>
                     <li>internet sources—websites and articles, journals etc available only online</li>
                     <li>other media sources—films, TV and radio programmes</li>
                     <li>any other published information containing ideas and information relating to the student’s
                        choice of topic.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Students must be sure that their sources are both relevant and reliable. They must
                     consider the credibility of the publication, organization and author as well as the
                     source’s date. They should be aware that search engines themselves may be biased in
                     the sources they suggest.
                  </p>
                  <p>This secondary research helps the students to refine their research question and begin
                     to answer it. It also helps the students to:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>identify additional sources to investigate</li>
                     <li>gain an insight into what methods earlier researchers used</li>
                     <li>consider new aspects of the topic that were outcomes from previous research</li>
                     <li>gain an overview of questions that were asked in past interviews and surveys.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The findings from this reading can stimulate new and creative approaches to further
                     research.

               <h3>Reliability of secondary sources</h3>
               <p>It is important that the students consult relevant and reliable sources. Students
                  need to evaluate the sources that they use for their secondary research.
               </p>
               <p>The question usually emerges about the reliability of wikis, online encyclopaedias
                  and other similar information sites
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>. These kinds of sources may be useful in the initial stages of research to gain an
                  overview of a topic. However, an over-reliance on them should be avoided.

               <h3>How to take notes, annotate and bookmark</h3>
               <p>Students should be encouraged to take detailed notes from sources that they use.</p>
               <p>There are many different techniques that students can learn. Using their RRS may be
                  a good way for many students to collate information in one place.
               </p>
               <p>Some students may need help to become skilled in note-taking. The EE coordinator or
                  librarian can organize study skills training for their cohort of students.
               </p>
               <p>Annotating is an excellent skill for making critical commentary or explanatory notes
                  on a piece of text, image or table, for example. It encourages students to read actively.
                  They can use different colours to code different parts of a text, underline or circle
                  important parts, pose questions or simply express a reaction to what they are reading.
               </p>
               <p>Students can bookmark online sources by using either the bookmarking feature in a
                  browser or an online social bookmarking tool such as 
                  <a href="https://www.diigo.com/">Diigo</a> (
                  <a href="https://www.diigo.com/">https://www.diigo.com/</a>). They can select tags so that they can easily find useful articles and resources
                  again. If these tools are deemed useful for students, the EE coordinator may need
                  to arrange training for students.
               </p>
               <img src="**insert link url**" alt="**insert alt text**"></img>
               <p>Likewise, students can copy text and images from online sources into a word processor
                  and annotate them, or annotate them online using available tools. The videos listed
                  in “Online resources” show both approaches.
               </p>
               <p>Students may wish to create a bibliographic entry at the top of the copied text using
                  an online citation service, and the librarian may be able to show them how to undertake
                  this with suggested tools. Please note that such citations must meet the minimum requirements
                  of the IB as outlined in the 
                  <em>Extended essay guide</em> and

            <h2>Creating an annotated bibliography</h2>
            <p>An annotated bibliography provides a concise summary of each source and some assessment
               of its value and relevance. It is excellent preparation for carrying out independent
               research.

            <div class="section">
               <h3>Annotated bibliography—its function</h3>
               <p>The process is not just a matter of listing possible sources. It also requires students
                  to think critically. They must consider the sources in terms of:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>what has already been written about their chosen topic and</li>
                  <li>how their own research will fit into this.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>As they examine each source, students will need to identify the issues and different
                  perspectives of others. This will help them to develop their reasoned argument.
               </p>
               <p>A good annotated bibliography will:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Allow students to keep track of their reading.</li>
                  <li>Encourage students to think critically about the sources they are using in relation
                     to their own research area.
                  </li>
                  <li>Allow students, quite early on in the process, to become aware of possible concerns
                     about using certain sources.
                  </li>
                  <li>Help students determine whether a source is of use to them in their research.</li>
                  <li>Help students to justify their use of particular sources, both to their supervisor
                     and to the examiner.
                  </li>
                  <li>Help students with the planning of their research, and ultimately save them time.</li>
                  <li>Enable students to develop their critical thinking skills in selecting and evaluating
                     source material.
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">The annotated bibliography is a planning tool to help students manage their research
                  and time. It must not be included in the EE as an appendix.
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">The insights students gain from compiling the bibliography will inform and shape the
                  discussion of source material within the essay.

               <h3>How to compile an annotated bibliography</h3>
               <p>There are many ways to format an annotated bibliography, and librarians may be a good
                  source of advice on this. Generally, an annotated bibliography consists of:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the bibliographic information</li>
                  <li>the annotations (a concise summary of the source).</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The annotations will vary in length depending on whether the student is writing a
                  summary of the source or analysing it.
               </p>
               <p>A summary should include:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>a concise summary of the content and theme(s) of the source</li>
                  <li>a comment on the authority of the author</li>
                  <li>a comment on the purpose of the source</li>
                  <li>a comment on how this source might be useful.</li>

            <h2>Conducting primary research</h2>
            <p>Primary research is the collecting of original data.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that not all subjects permit the use of primary methods as
               part of the research process for the EE—it is important that students carefully check
               their subject guidelines before starting.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>What is the purpose of primary research?</h3>
               <p>After the literature review or secondary research is completed, students must analyse
                  their findings and:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>determine to what extent they answer the research question</li>
                  <li>find agreement between authors</li>
                  <li>find disagreement, where the evidence reveals differences in points of view or findings.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>At this point students may decide to investigate further by carrying out their own
                  primary research, in other words by collecting their own data.
               </p>
               <p>The students must choose a method or methods that are appropriate to the research
                  question and that are commonly used in the particular Diploma subject. Again, students
                  must be reminded here that, although the method may be appropriate for the subject,
                  it may not be permitted in relation to the EE.
               </p>
               <p>Possible data collection methods include:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>experiments
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
                  <li>investigations
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
                  <li>interviews
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
                  <li>surveys.
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>The details of how the data was collected are crucial to the validity of any argument
                  based on the findings. Students must put in the main body of their essay the details
                  of any primary research they carry out. These include:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the methods used</li>
                  <li>the persons involved</li>
                  <li>how and why these were selected</li>
                  <li>the relevant results</li>
                  <li>any limitations and biases that may have influenced the results.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Examiners will not refer to, and are not required to read, information presented in
                  an appendix, therefore any information relevant to the argument of the essay, or justification
                  of the findings presented, must be included in the main body. The assessment of the
                  essay will be affected if students put this information in an appendix. However, students
                  may need to put some supplementary material into an appendix—for example, the transcript
                  of an interview or a list of survey questions (for more guidance on this please see
                  “The researching and writing process”
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>).

            <div class="section">
               <h3>Preparation for primary research</h3>
               <p>Students must follow the accepted process for carrying out their chosen method of
                  research—how the data is recorded, analysed and presented. Otherwise, their data will
                  have little value.
               </p>
               <p>Students need to plan carefully how to carry out their research. In most cases, there
                  will be only one opportunity to collect primary data from a particular source.
               </p>
               <p>It is extremely important that students approach their research in an ethical and
                  legal manner. See 
                  <em>Ethical guidelines for extended essays research and fieldwork</em>
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>.

               <h3>Quantitative vs qualitative research</h3>
               <p>Primary research involves either 
                  <strong>quantitative</strong> or 
                  <strong>qualitative</strong> research methods.
               </p>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Quantitative research</h4>
                  <p>Quantitative research follows a well-defined process that yields data that can be
                     analysed statistically.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>outcomes from experiments</li>
                     <li>data collected from surveys where responses involve closed or multiple-choice responses.</li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Qualitative research</h4>
                  <p>Qualitative research collects information that may reflect opinions or personal perspectives
                     on a particular situation. The data that is collected gives an overall impression
                     and generally cannot be analysed statistically.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>responses in interviews</li>
                     <li>open-ended questions in surveys.</li>
                  </ul>

            <div class="section">
               <h3>Research methods</h3>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Experiments</h4>
                  <p>Experiments can be conducted and their data collected using systematic methods and
                     well-defined processes.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>using the scientific method in conducting science experiments</li>
                     <li>simulating an experiment on using mobile phone technology to determine the location
                        of a person.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Experiments usually involve quantitative processes to collect and analyse the resulting
                     data.

                  <ul>
                     <li>examining original sources, for example:</li>
                     <li>maps</li>
                     <li>photographs</li>
                     <li>historical documents</li>
                     <li>company policies</li>

                     <li>original art.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Investigations of original source material can reveal whether a particular situation
                     exists or to what extent it does. Investigations can also extract and analyse data
                     from original sources to demonstrate that a particular outcome does occur.

                  <h4>Interviews</h4>
                  <p>Interviews may be conducted:</p>

                     <li>face-to-face</li>
                     <li>by email</li>

                     <li>by online chat.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Interviews can be with one person or a small group, also called a 
                     <strong>focus group</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>Face-to-face interviews have the advantage of allowing the interviewer to ask follow-up
                     questions during the interview.
                  </p>
                  <p>Successful interviews require careful preparation, including:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>developing questions related to the research question and the findings from secondary
                        research
                     </li>
                     <li>trialling the questions before the actual interview</li>
                     <li>deciding on the best methodology for conducting and recording the interview</li>
                     <li>making the purpose and use of the data collected well known in advance</li>
                     <li>in some cases, providing the interviewee with the questions in advance</li>
                     <li>assuring the anonymity of the interviewee if requested.</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>The researcher is better able to control who is responding to the questions when using

                  </p>
                  <p>Successful surveys require:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>knowing from the secondary research what areas need to be investigated</li>

                  <p>To collect qualitative data, the survey must ask open-ended questions, which allow

               </p>
               <p>The data collected must be:</p>

                  <li>replicable.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Questions for students to consider are:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>What do they want to find out from their primary research?</li>
                  <li>How will this relate to the findings from the secondary research?</li>
                  <li>How will the data collected relate to the research question they have posed?</li>
                  <li>What is the best method to collect relevant and reliable data and from where?</li>
                  <li>Are there any ethical or legal considerations to using a primary method that must
                     be taken into account?
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>The analysis of primary research includes:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the analysis of the data collected</li>
                  <li>the connections the student makes between the different sources of information used—for
                     example, secondary and primary research.
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <p>The supervisor plays a key role here. Considering the advantages and disadvantages
                  of different research methods is an essential part of the planning process. This will
                  help to ensure that students collect the data and information they need to explore
                  their research question.

               <h3>Problems emerging from primary research</h3>
               <p>A badly designed or implemented experiment or investigation will lead to flawed results.
                  Students, after consultation with their supervisor, may still write an EE based on
                  flawed primary research.
               </p>
               <p>However, it is better to avoid the problem. Primary research can fail because:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>The survey sample is too small or badly controlled so the student cannot reach any
                     conclusions relevant to the research question.
                  </li>
                  <li>The survey/interview questions do not take proper account of the secondary research
                     findings or the research question, and so do not lead to relevant conclusions.
                  </li>
                  <li>Unacceptable methods were used to collect information, such as:</li>
                  <li>using a recording device without the interviewee being aware that the interview was
                     being recorded
                  </li>
                  <li>taking photos in prohibited areas</li>
                  <li>downloading copyrighted music to demonstrate how it is done.</li>
                  <li>These are all examples of where a student might be deemed to have breached IB regulations
                     and ethical guidelines.
                  </li>
                  <li>Students have used a research method that is not permitted or not appropriate for
                     the subject in which they are submitting their EE.

            <h2>Ethical considerations for the EE</h2>
            <p>In the research process, the supervisor needs to ensure that students are aware of
               what are considered to be acceptable practices.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Acceptable methodology and ethical practices</h3>
               <p>Although IB publications cannot cover all possible situations for acceptable methodologies
                  and ethical practices, these two provide specific policies to consider:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <em>Ethical guidelines for extended essays research and fieldwork</em>
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <em>IB animal experimentation policy</em>
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK].</hi>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>The first includes what is considered to be acceptable methodology, in terms of ethical
                  and legal considerations. For example, downloading pirated software, music or videos
                  or attempting to bypass security systems are not accepted. In the sciences, students
                  must adhere to the IB animal experimentation policy
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>. Supervisors must ensure that students are aware of, and understand the implications
                  of breaching, IB regulations in this regard.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Academic honesty</h3>
               <p>There are several IB publications that address how to correctly cite and reference
                  sources and also what constitutes academic honesty. For example:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <em>Effective citing and referencing</em>
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <em>Academic honesty in the IB educational context</em>
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>In addition to these documents, supervisors are advised to refer to the relevant sections
                  of this TSM and the 
                  <em>Extended essay guide</em>. Students risk their IB Diploma if they are found to have breached IB regulations
                  with regard to academic honesty.

            <h2>[S] How to format the extended essay: a guide for students</h2>
            <p>Your extended essay is a formally written research paper and you should strive to
               present it as professionally as you can.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Font and spacing</h3>
               <p>It is strongly recommended that you use a readable 12-point font and double spacing.
                  This will also help your examiners read and assess your essay on-screen.
               </p>
               <p>Submitting a paper in the recommended format will set a serious tone. Take a look
                  at the example text below formatted in two drastically different fonts. Notice the
                  difference in tone and mood—which format would be easier for the examiner to read,
                  assess and comment on?

                     of the government, as its demand will rise as a result of the rise in COE prices of
                     relatively new cars. However, its full impact cannot be determined as its supply fluctuates
                     in different time periods as the government predefines the number of quotas released

               <anchor id="h.6qp623qcdi8u"></anchor>The authenticity of the EE is crucial. If students are found to have breached IB regulations
               on academic honesty or ethical research guidelines, they will jeopardize their Diploma.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Academic honesty</h3>
               <p>Three elements of the process help to ensure that the essay is all the student’s own
                  work:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the mentoring nature of the supervisor–student relationship</li>
                  <li>the use of the reflection process</li>
                  <li>regular supervision sessions.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The goal is to develop the values and skills associated with academic integrity in
                  order to prevent academic misconduct.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Training</h3>
               <p>The DP/EE coordinator, librarian or other suitably qualified person can lead training
                  on academic honesty with the whole student cohort.
               </p>
               <p>The supervisor can then follow up on this in individual sessions with students. The
                  supervisor can ensure that students have the necessary skills and understand the consequences
                  of academic misconduct.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Academic dishonesty—what to do</h3>
               <p>If, at any stage, you suspect a student of academic misconduct, you should immediately
                  discuss this with the student. You must make the student aware of the problem and
                  its potential implications.
               </p>
               <p>You should also tell the DP/EE coordinator about the problem.</p>
               <p>In most cases, the student will simply require more help with citation and referencing
                  skills.
               </p>
               <p>The table below outlines how best to ensure that all students understand what it means
                  to be academically honest in the writing of their essay.

            <h2>Summary of the research and writing process</h2>
            <p>An EE is an authentic piece of work following the research process:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Students undertake preliminary reading on their chosen topic and formulate a working
                  research question.
               </li>
               <li>Students gather evidence from reliable and relevant secondary sources to begin to
                  answer their working research question. They may refine the question as they read.
               </li>
               <li>Students analyse the information they have gathered so far to determine:</li>
               <li>To what extent is the information from the various sources consistent?</li>
               <li>What additional information do they need to answer their question?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students collect the information they need by primary or further secondary research:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>They compare/contrast the evidence collected from secondary sources with each other
                  or with the findings from the primary research and formulate a conclusion that answers
                  their research question.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The balance between secondary and primary research depends on:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>the nature of the research question</li>
               <li>the guidance given for the student’s choice of subject.</li>

            <p>The EE must:</p>

            <p class="Notebody">
               <strong>Note</strong>: Much of the practical advice in this section is taken from 
               <em>Art of Reflection</em>
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK] by </hi>Dinos Aristidou, which we recommend you read in full at your leisure.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">For more on reflection generally see: Moon, JA. 2000. 
               <em>Reflection in learning and professional development: Theory and practice</em>. Routledge.
            </p>
            <p>The art of reflection, though generally acknowledged as an important aspect of education
               and as a significant feature of all IB programmes, is rarely taught as a discrete
               skill. There is a general, but often vague, understanding about what constitutes reflection.
               It is often defined as personal writing, the description of feelings or the documentation
               of processes or evaluation. Though its significance is recognized, it is often too
               quickly sacrificed if time is an issue and it is quickly consigned to homework. This
               is a natural response as reflection is something that we consider to be primarily
               a personal or even a private process, a notion propagated by the long tradition of
               published diaries and the journals that give us access to the thoughts, discoveries,
               reflections and personal lives of their originators.
            </p>
            <p>There is also a sense that it is such a natural and inherent human faculty, especially
               in relation to learning, that it needs only to be refined rather than taught. The
               development of the skill of reflection is therefore something we see as being “caught”
               rather than “taught”. Teachers recognize and acknowledge meaningful reflection but
               sometimes find it challenging to transform students’ affective descriptions of learning
               experiences into relevant and authentic reflection. Furthermore, we use the word “reflection”
               to describe both a 
               <strong>product</strong>—“Here is my reflection”—and a 
               <strong>process</strong>—“It’s time for reflection”—which can confuse the matter further.

               <h3>Learning</h3>
               <p>Reflection plays an important role in the evaluation of what was learned and how it
                  was learned.
               </p>
               <p>It gives students the opportunity to:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>plan and track their process of learning</li>
                  <li>record their discoveries</li>
                  <li>make connections with prior learning.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The act of reflection:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>is a conscious search for meaning and of making meaning</li>
                  <li>enables students to distance themselves from their learning and to view it from the
                     outside
                  </li>
                  <li>allows students to become aware of their cognitive frameworks.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Through reflection, students develop an objective understanding of themselves as learners.</p>

            <div class="section">
               <h3>Action</h3>
               <p>Reflection is an invisible process that goes on inside our heads constantly. We 
                  <strong>consciously</strong> reflect when, for example:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>something significant has happened</li>
                  <li>we have a decision to make</li>
                  <li>we’re working on something</li>
                  <li>we’re stuck</li>
                  <li>we’ve just completed something</li>
                  <li>we’ve been asked to do something</li>
                  <li>we’ve encountered the unexpected or the unfamiliar</li>
                  <li>our equilibrium has been disturbed</li>
                  <li>we are encountering, anticipating or seeking change.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If this reflection is deep enough, it gives us lasting insights or knowledge—what
                  we call experience, something we can call up subsequently to help guide our responses.
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Reflection can inform action.</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Identity</h3>
               <p>Reflection is a key part of our personal development and identity. It gives us self-knowledge
                  and a consciousness regard for who we are and our place in the world.
               </p>
               <p>Our reflections, therefore, can become a complex map that not only directs us towards
                  a destination but also charts all the routes we’ve already travelled, the places we’ve
                  been to, the resources we’ve had and how we have used them. They locate us and position
                  us.
               </p>
               <p>Reflecting on our reflections—
                  <strong>secondary reflection</strong>—allows us to distance ourselves from ourselves. It provides us with a process to
                  understand ourselves better.
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Reflection enables us to understand ourselves better as people and as learners.</li>

            <h2>Reflection and representation</h2>
            <p>Students have to show evidence of their reflection, so that it can be assessed on
               the RPPF as evidence of their engagement with learning. We often confuse reflection
               with the representation and recording of reflection. The RRS, for example, in a workbook
               or journal and the RPPF are the representations of reflection rather than the reflection
               itself.
            </p>
            <p>For others, reflection is synonymous with evaluation, a judgment based upon the extent
               to which original intentions and goals have been met. Though any of these can constitute
               reflection, it is important for both teachers and students to differentiate between
               them. Both reflection and the representation of reflection have their particular functions,
               formats and processes.
            </p>
            <p>We need, therefore, to be clear about the difference between:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>reflecting</li>
               <li>recording reflection retrospectively</li>
               <li>recording as reflection</li>
               <li>reflecting on reflection (secondary reflection).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Teachers should ensure that throughout the year students are required to reflect in
               all these different ways.

               <strong>Recording reflection retrospectively</strong>, eg the students think about something they learned the week before and present it

            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">
               <strong>Recording as reflection</strong>, eg the students write an answer to a set question, reflecting on it as they write,
               providing a series of different responses.
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">
               <strong>Reflecting on reflection</strong>, eg students examine the collage they created to represent prior learning. They reflect
               on why they have represented it in that particular way and what it reveals about their
               learning and thought processes.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Breaking the flow</h3>
               <p>We are sometimes reluctant to introduce reflection in case it breaks the flow of the
                  learning experience.
               </p>
               <p>However, reflection activities can be carefully placed interventions that intentionally
                  break the flow of the experience. Students thus have the opportunity to reflect on
                  what was happening and why they did what they did.
               </p>
               <p>These moments of reflection are key to learning and learning to learn. They are moments
                  when thought and emotion come together, synthesizing an individual’s cognitive and
                  affective responses into an insight.

            <h2>Secondary reflection</h2>
            <p>Secondary reflection is the act of reflecting on previous reflections—looking back,
               seeking connections, identifying significance, setting down markers and making meaning.
            </p>
            <p>Secondary reflection:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>examines the relationship between past and present learning</li>
               <li>explores the similarities and differences between the past and the present</li>
               <li>identifies the relationship between the students’ context, their actions and the consequences
                  of their actions.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In doing this, it makes greater sense of the reflection that has been documented (see
               “Study/cognitive journals”
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>).
            </p>
            <p>It is a way of using the past to inform both the present (how I learn and act) and
               the future (my future learning and intended actions). It becomes a marker of learning:
            </p>
            <ul>

               <h3>The purpose of written reflection</h3>
               <p>Reflection, through the act of writing, gives students the ability to record and structure
                  experience and to make sense of the world. They take ownership of their experiences
                  and discover a voice with which to communicate experience and thought.
               </p>
               <p>This notion of voice is referred to in assessment criterion E: engagement. Our personal
                  voice is related to the way we perceive and describe experience and the words that
                  we use to communicate thought and feeling.
               </p>
               <p>The written reflection captures thought and also enables us to 
                  <strong>formulate</strong> thought.
               </p>
               <p>The act of writing becomes not only an act of memory, remembering and recounting,
                  but also an act of becoming.
               </p>
               <p>We develop not only our understandings as we write, but our identity, too.</p>

               <h3>Function of reflection in an educational context</h3>
               <p>Three primary functions of written records of reflection in an educational context
                  are:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Study/cognitive</strong>—focusing on ideas, research, evaluations, concepts, discoveries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Process/procedural</strong>—focusing on problem-solving, inspirations, ideas, workings, processes, systems of
                     exploration.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Autobiographical/affective</strong>—focusing on personal rants, raves, achievements, frustrations, discoveries, experiences,
                     insights.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>The format of reflection is often determined by the particular record’s function:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Study/cognitive</strong>—words, diagrams and research.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Process/procedural</strong>—fragmented writing, charts, pictures, doodles, experiments. It is very rarely continuous
                     text.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Autobiographical/affective</strong>—visuals (drawings and photographs) and words written in a personal register, focusing
                     on the affective and on the personal.
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <p class="NoteHeading1">Ordering the RRS</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Students can divide the space according to its three functions: study/cognitive; process/procedural;
                  autobiographical/affective.
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Students can order the reflections chronologically, with a table of contents to indicate
                  which form of reflection each contribution relates to.
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">A loose-leaf folder or electronic space allows students to (re)arrange their reflections
                  in a variety of combinations. This provides new insights, helps problem-solving and
                  provides opportunities to discuss the material from different perspectives.

               <p>The study journal is a record of study and of the development of new understandings.

               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">Students should ensure they date all their journal entries.</p>
               <p>Secondary reflection is the key process for discovering and making these connections
                  and patterns. It enables students to:

               <ul>
                  <li>combine ideas, concepts and understandings to develop new ideas, concepts and understandings</li>

               <p class="Notebody">Students can try colour coding or tagging their learning and research with appropriate
                  titles so that records can be organized in different ways.
               </p>
               <p>The study journal enables students to look at their learning objectively as the “big
                  picture”. They can then find pathways of learning through it by examining it 
                  <strong>relatively</strong> rather than independently.
               </p>
               <p>This forms the basis of interdisciplinary learning and creative thinking—the ability
                  to connect the seemingly disconnected and to justify these connections.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondary reflection should also be used to extract the significance from the learning.

               <p>The problem may be an equation, a sports match, a project, a scientific experiment
                  or the writing of a play—but the process/procedural journal is a quest for a successful
                  outcome. It is organic because we attack a problem again and again in different ways
                  in order to generate new insights.

                  <h4>Productive doubt</h4>
                  <p>Each question and each problem is unique and has its own particular procedures. For
                     true creativity to occur and for the unexpected to be discovered, each problem must
                     be approached afresh, going beyond the predictable.
                  </p>
                  <p>The process/procedural journal is therefore by definition a place of uncertainty and
                     students are best advised to embrace a state of doubt. This is doubt free of anxiety,
                     a productive doubt that leads to curiosity and perseverance. Productive doubt is motivational,
                     encouraging the students to inquire if there’s a better solution even as answers begin
                     to present themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>In the procedural journal, insight and inspiration sit among the obvious and the irrelevant
                     and need to be sought out.

                  <li>
                     <strong>Positioning</strong>—where we stand in relation to the world and to others and what we do/how we intend

                  <p class="NoteHeading1">Perspectives</p>

            <h2>RRS—some examples</h2>
            <p>The RRS
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi> is a personal learning environment that can be either a physical or virtual support
               tool. It is a space in which students are able to record reflections on what they
               are reading, writing and thinking. It can help students to prepare for their reflection
               sessions with their supervisors and inform the discussions that take place. In preparing
               for their reflection sessions students could use their RRS to:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>record their reflections</li>
               <li>respond to artifacts, such as photos, newspaper clippings, Twitter feeds, blogs, etc</li>
               <li>respond to prompts and questions that may arise in the students’ subject areas, TOK
                  classes or other aspects of the Diploma Programme
               </li>
               <li>create mind maps</li>
               <li>record emerging questions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many students already keep research journals in the planning, researching and writing
               phases of their EE. Encouraging students to develop an RRS will help them manage their
               workload and focus on their EE.
            </p>

               <h3>The role of the RRS</h3>
               <p>Created by students to help them plan and make decisions in their research process,
                  the RRS fosters critical and evaluative thinking skills.
               </p>
               <p>It also supports the development of 
                  <em>Approaches to learning</em>
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi> skills and the conceptual understandings that occur throughout the research process.
               </p>
               <p>Additionally, the RRS tracks the evolution of students’ thinking as they develop their
                  argument.
               </p>
               <p>It helps the students to connect personally to the topic and may motivate them in
                  meaningful ways to successfully complete the EE.
               </p>
               <p>The RRS is intended to make the entire supervision process more meaningful.</p>
               <p>Insights and information recorded in the RRS are expected to form the basis for, and
                  find direct expression in, the essay, reflection sessions and RPPF
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>. Students are expected to share excerpts from the RRS in discussions with their supervisor.
                  Using these reflections as a point of reference in their supervision sessions, students
                  will be able to:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>demonstrate their planning</li>
                  <li>discuss what they are learning</li>
                  <li>evaluate their progress.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Finally, the RRS enables supervisors to authenticate the student voice more effectively
                  as the RRS contains elements that will eventually be found in the essay itself.
               </p>
               <p>The following exemplars are just a few of the ways in which students might use their
                  RRS.

            </ul>
            <p>It is easier to reflect on something concrete, so it is recommended that the supervisor

               <strong>reflection prompts</strong> to encourage discussion.

            <p>Reflection prompts can be:</p>

            <p>It may help supervisors to think in terms of the three mandatory reflection sessions

            <p>The RPPF enables examiners to gain an insight into students’ thinking processes while

               and skills have developed during this time.

               of the overall EE assessment.

            <p>It is important to stress with students that examiners want to gain an insight into

               <strong>Criterion E assesses the student’s engagement with their research focus and the research

               highly against criterion E. Students who have struggled with the EE can nonetheless

               their own personal development.

            <p>Once students have entered a reflection on the RPPF, they must not amend it with hindsight.
               Amendments will undermine the authenticity of the reflection and may hide the development

            <h2>Supervisor comments and analysis</h2>
            <p>Supervisors should write their comments after conducting the viva voce with students.</p>
            <p>The comments are summative in nature. They should reflect the whole process and the

               voce).
            </p>
            <p>The examiner will assess the RPPF against criterion E, but supervisors should not
               attempt to do the examiner’s job with their comments. The supervisor’s comments should
               provide supporting evidence and context for what the student has shown on the RPPF.

                     <td class="Tablebody">
                        <p class="Tablebody">The candidate’s connection with her topic is of a rather personal nature: as a matter
                           of fact, one would be hard-pressed to identify an example that would hit closer to
                           home. The student is Lebanese and lived in Lebanon, raised by a Shia Muslim father
                           and Sunni mother.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">The EE process turned out to be a rewarding one, as it offered the candidate the unique
                           and invaluable opportunity to study and begin to understand a conflict that she was
                           aware of but not familiar with in terms of the historical significance of names, events
                           and places. By looking at the facts, the student discovered that the underlying cause
                           was religious factionalism.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">In addition, the candidate was surprised how she was able to maintain an objective
                           distance from the topic, despite her background.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">One difficult aspect involving the research process was getting started in terms of
                           laying the foundation and finding reliable historians. However, once started, and
                           after finding several good sources, everything moved forward smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">Another challenge involved time management and the writing and rewriting of the essay.
                           In general, the student spent most of her time establishing how various religious
                           groups in Lebanon viewed each other and, in relation to this, how to separate opinions
                           from facts.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">Overall, in the candidate’s assessment, the EE process was very much worth it. Main
                           future application and benefit of having gone through said process is an awareness
                           of the importance of managing one’s time well by getting a head start and spacing
                           out time wisely. The candidate appreciated how the personal nature of the essay made
                           her motivated to want to write and research.

                        <p class="Tablebody">E mentioned that she particularly enjoyed researching and analysing entire product
                           ads and campaigns, yet she felt the need to select representative ads to analyse more
                           carefully considering the scope of the EE. She also commented that she was surprised
                           to find that beer advertisements are so culturally oriented.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Tablebody">She explained that the difficulties she encountered in the EE were mostly with the
                           writing process itself, as she struggles with writing generally. Thus, her advice
                           to other students is to spread out the EE writing, so that there is more time to write
                           and revise under less time pressure. Finally, E explained that she learned the value
                           of time management through the EE, since she did not always manage her time well and
                           she struggled to meet internal deadlines.

                        <p class="Tablebody">E’s comments during the viva voce illustrated a fairly good degree of critical analysis
                           and depth of understanding of her research question.

            <h2>Overview of the WSEE</h2>
            <p>The WSEE invites students to conduct an in-depth, 
               <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> investigation into an issue of contemporary global importance (maximum 4,000 words).
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Topics</h3>

               <h3>Interdisciplinary approach</h3>
               <p>The perspective of just one subject may not be adequate to address complex issues
                  like these. The WSEE therefore requires students to bring together aspects of different
                  disciplines to illuminate their chosen topic.
               </p>
               <p>The IB recommends that the student uses two disciplines. These must be Diploma Programme
                  subjects, one of which the student must be studying.
               </p>
               <p>Students are not expected to address the topic in its full complexity, but should
                  aim to generate understandings that are new to them.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Aims</h3>
               <p>The aims of the WSEE are to enable students to:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>frame and understand complex contemporary world problems for in-depth study</li>
                  <li>gather and synthesize insights from two different disciplines to better understand
                     the issue
                  </li>
                  <li>develop global consciousness—a disposition to recognize and understand local and global
                     relationships in dynamic interaction
                  </li>
                  <li>view themselves as interpreters of and actors in an increasingly interconnected world.</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Focus</h3>
               <p>Students are encouraged to focus on just 
                  <strong>one or two contexts</strong> in some depth, for example:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>The student examines two geographical case studies to explore whether religious beliefs
                     affect attitudes towards HIV/AIDS in Oslo and Mombasa.
                  </li>
                  <li>The student examines one or two events to evaluate relief efforts after natural disasters,
                     and suggests ways to make these more responsive.
                  </li>
                  <li>The student examines one or two interventions to investigate what determines the success
                     or failure of sanctions imposed by the United Nations.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Students can refer to other places and events beyond the primary context(s) when relevant
                  to the argument. In fact, the IB encourages this as it displays global consciousness.
                  However, a detailed contextualized study of these additional cases is impossible within
                  the 4,000-word limit.

               </p>
               <p>Considering the global themes will also enable students to:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>check that the interdisciplinary WSEE is a better way to explore their topic than
                     the single subject essay

            <h2>Defining interdisciplinary study</h2>
            <p>In interdisciplinary study, students integrate knowledge and modes of thinking from
               two or more disciplines to gain a deeper understanding of an issue. Crucially, they
               would have been unable to gain this understanding if they only looked at the issue
               from the perspective of one of the disciplines.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>The interdisciplinary essay</h3>
               <p>A strong interdisciplinary essay exhibits the following attributes.</p>
               <div class="section">

                  <ul>

                        is best examined in an interdisciplinary way.
                     </li>
                     <li>The student has a sense of the significance of the research.</li>

               <h3>Interdisciplinary research</h3>
               <p>Interdisciplinary research in the IB is not “a-disciplinary” or “anti-disciplinary”.
                  It draws rigorously on discipline-specific ways of knowing—established knowledge claims,
                  methods, approaches to inquiry and forms of communication—to inform a new understanding.
               </p>
               <p>In conducting independent interdisciplinary research, students will:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>explore problems, ideas and issues from the perspective of two IB subject areas</li>
                  <li>build the inquiry skills necessary for conducting rigorous and age-appropriate research</li>
                  <li>exercise initiative in applying thinking skills critically and creatively to recognize,
                     frame and approach complex problems of global significance.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Interdisciplinary research values the process of learning, as well as its results.
                  The process involves students in:
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Identifying a topic of personal, local* and global significance.</li>
                  <li>Framing a researchable question.</li>
                  <li>Identifying the sources of expertise and disciplinary perspectives to further their
                     understanding of the topic.
                  </li>
                  <li>Gathering relevant information, ideas and tools in such disciplines.</li>
                  <li>Defining a research approach or method.</li>
                  <li>Synthesizing the different perspectives to advance their own interpretation or explanation
                     of, or solution to, the problem under study.
                  </li>
                  <li>Crafting the essay and reflecting on their work, its significance, limitations and
                     possibilities.
                  </li>
               </ol>
               <p>Students begin the interdisciplinary research process with their initial beliefs about
                  their chosen topics.
               </p>
               <p>As they gather findings, consider theories and make connections, they revise and enrich
                  their initial views. Students capture the process of building their understanding
                  in the RRS
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi> and the RPPF
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>. They receive informative feedback from their supervisors, which in turn deepens
                  their understanding.

                  <p class="Notebody">He used concepts from environmental systems and societies such as “end-of-pipe protection”
                     and “cyclonic separation”, as well as tools such as a “water balance flow diagram”
                     and an “analysis of pollution or inefficiency” to assess the potential environmental
                     advantages of adopting a cleaner production approach.

                  <p class="Notebody">Through his study, he convincingly demonstrated that cleaner production makes environmental

            <h2>Disciplinary lenses</h2>
            <p>Academic disciplines play a key role in students’ interdisciplinary work.</p>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Subjects and subject groups</h3>
               <p>Most often a WSEE draws on subjects from across subject groups. The subjects can be
                  within the same group—but, to allow for an interdisciplinary approach, students must
                  not choose subjects that are too similar, for example economics and business management.
               </p>
               <p>Students are advised to use only two Diploma Programme subjects, one of which they
                  must be studying already.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
               <h3>Interdisciplinary understanding</h3>
               <p>Students show interdisciplinary understanding when (with their supervisor’s support)
                  they select insights from two disciplines or subject areas to address the topic of
                  their choice.
               </p>
               <p>Students must consider:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>what discipline might best inform their work</li>
                  <li>what particular insights from the discipline will be most relevant.</li>
               </ul>
               <div class="section">
                  <h4>Level of understanding</h4>
                  <p>Students are not expected to achieve comprehensive mastery of disciplines before their
                     interdisciplinary research. However, they are expected to demonstrate a deep understanding
                     of the particular theories, concepts or methods they use.
                  </p>
                  <p>There are multiple aspects of a discipline that can inform an interdisciplinary project:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>theories, conceptual frameworks, concepts or findings (eg from biology, history, mathematics
                        or economics)
                     </li>
                     <li>distinct disciplinary methods, research instruments or approaches to inquiry</li>
                     <li>characteristic communicative styles, languages or symbol systems.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Theory of knowledge
                     <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi> can also help students understand the nature of disciplinary work and decide which
                     disciplinary insights will produce meaningful connections across academic areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>By grounding their research in disciplines and established areas of expertise, students
                     avoid superficial or solely journalistic accounts of their chosen topic.

                     </graphic>It is important that students understand academic disciplines as dynamic networks
                     of concepts, theories and examples that are produced through the use of agreed-upon
                     methods and techniques to answer questions about the world.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Before they begin their research, ask students to use the lens of the biologist, the
                     geographer, the historian, the scientist, the artist or the poet to provide an initial
                     answer to their question.

                  <p class="NoteHeading1">Example: an investigation of villagers’ attitudes to water filtration</p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Nira, a student in Mombasa, focused her essay on the adoption of new water sanitation
                     systems in a nearby rural village.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Following an outbreak of illnesses there, students in a creativity, action, service
                     (CAS) project tested the quality of tap and well water available to villagers. They
                     discovered a high concentration of bacteria in the water.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Nira devised and tested an inexpensive home-made microfiltration system better capable
                     of capturing pathogens in the water. When the villagers refused to adopt the new filter,
                     Nira sought to understand the values and beliefs that lay behind this refusal.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Nira’s essay drew on biology and anthropology.</p>
                  <p class="Notebody">She defined water-borne pathogens and explained their impact on human health in areas
                     of poor water sanitation. She characterized the global scope of the problem by showing
                     that deaths from diarrhoeic diseases are typically concentrated in poorer areas without
                     sewage systems. Nira explained the mechanisms that make microfiltration preferable
                     to boiling the water or using regular filters.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Nira wanted to understand how the villagers usually filtered the tap and well water.
                     She collected information through interviews and questionnaires, as well as on-site
                     observation. Her goal was to understand how villagers made sense of water quality
                     and filtration processes and why they would prefer less reliable methods.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Taking an anthropologist’s perspective, Nira concluded that the villagers’ refusal
                     to use the new filter resulted from financial considerations rather than ignorance.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Notebody">Through her research Nira came to view her interviewees as embedded in complex social
                     systems that placed important demands on them. Their spending priorities were education
                     for their children, house maintenance, clothing and food. Nira realized that, for
                     the villagers to adopt her filtration method, she would have to do more than simply
                     present the filter. For example, she would need an awareness programme to help the
                     villagers understand how getting sick through the existing methods cost them more
                     in the long run.

               <h3>Disciplinary knowledge and methodology</h3>
               <p>Experts within a discipline view their work as serving purposes that are often shared
                  with a number of their peers. For example:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>A biologist may seek to understand less than obvious factors affecting ecosystems
                     in order to protect biodiversity.
                  </li>
                  <li>A historian may study the Holocaust in order to understand the role of leaders in
                     the collapse of justice, while another may seek to shed light on cultural conditions.
                     Both may hope that the lessons learned will be useful.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Disciplinary practices vary widely.</p>
               <p>For example, two biologists are investigating animal social cooperation. The experimental
                  biologist studies fly populations in the laboratory. The environmental biologist tracks
                  a family of orangutans in Uganda. Their methods to investigate animal social cooperation
                  differ greatly, and their results and explanations may well do so, too.
               </p>
               <p>However, most importantly, both biologists’ perspectives are informed by disciplinary
                  knowledge and methodology. Their disciplinary expertise sets their different views
                  apart from unsubstantiated or naive opinion.
               </p>
               <p>It is very easy for students to rely on common-sense understanding of a global issue
                  or more informal insights. However, the academic nature of the EE requires students
                  to understand a global issue through disciplinary lenses.

               <h3>Selecting and evaluating disciplinary insights</h3>
               <p>Students need to look beyond a discipline’s content when exploring whether it will
                  be useful to their essay. They should also reflect on these aspects:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>insights</li>

                  <li>techniques</li>
                  <li>approaches</li>
                  <li>forms of communication.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Students can use their RRS
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi> to examine disciplines and seek advice from their supervisors or experts in relevant
                  fields.
               </p>
               <p>When students examine a rich topic they find that there are a number of disciplines
                  that they could use as a basis for their study.
               </p>
               <p>With their supervisor’s guidance, students must learn to evaluate the contributions
                  of each discipline and its particular theories, findings, methods or tools against
                  one another. Most importantly, they must evaluate each discipline against their research
                  goals.
               </p>
               <p>The evaluation of possible disciplinary insights should be a continual process.</p>

                  <li>Is this theory helpful?</li>

                  <li>Among the possible useful disciplinary perspectives I am considering, which ones should

               <p>In 
                  <strong>Nira’s essay investigating villagers’ attitudes to water filtration</strong>
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>, she could have used other or additional disciplines to inform her study. For example:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Economics could contribute an understanding of incentives and how they shape villagers’
                     behaviour.
                  </li>
                  <li>Geography’s search for patterns in human–environment interactions could offer information
                     about water sources in the region where the village is situated.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Yet, for her study to succeed, Nira had to decide which disciplines to exclude. The
                  best interdisciplinary projects select relevant disciplinary expertise to enable deep,
                  complex understanding.

               learning experiences yield

               <h3>Why integration matters</h3>
               <p>Interdisciplinary research requires students to develop the capacity to make deep
                  and productive connections across subjects. Building interdisciplinary understandings
                  requires more than merely “making connections”. Rather, it demands that students recognize:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>what kinds of connections they need to pursue</li>
                  <li>why such connections matter for the topic under study.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>For students to make careful analyses and meaningful connections, they need to know:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>How exactly do disciplines come together in this research question/topic?</li>
                  <li>In what ways does integrating disciplines contribute to a deeper, more nuanced and
                     complex understanding of the research question/topic?
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Successful integration of two or more subjects enables students to reach an understanding
                  that they would not have achieved through single disciplinary means.
               </p>
               <p>(For this 4,000-word essay, it is recommended that no more than two subjects are utilized.)</p>
               <p>Focusing on integration involves being able to identify how, exactly, the concepts,
                  methods, tools and genres of the disciplines combine productively. It invites students
                  to ask important questions about what they learn and the subjects they engage with.
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>How are different disciplines related to one another in a study of the selected research
                     area or specific research question?
                  </li>
                  <li>What insights are gained through the combination of perspectives that could not be
                     achieved by considering each discipline in isolation?
                  </li>
                  <li>Why does bringing these particular disciplines together in a study of the topic make
                     sense?

            <div class="section">
               <h3>How disciplines combine to produce a deeper understanding</h3>
               <p>Building integrative understandings invites students to make a variety of cross-disciplinary
                  connections. One consideration is key:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Integration must advance understanding of the selected topic in desirable ways.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Integrative understanding is most powerful when it clearly addresses the question
                  posed by the interdisciplinary inquiry. In particular, integration of disciplines
                  should enable the students to achieve the understanding framed within the chosen research
                  topic.

            <h2>Multiple forms of integration</h2>
            <p>There are a huge variety of ways in which the disciplines can be brought together
               meaningfully to address a given question. These fall into four distinct categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>complex explanation</li>
               <li>contextualization</li>

            <p class="Notebody">In his essay about the causes of a malaria epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, Pière integrates
               biology and environmental systems and societies. He asks why malaria is so prevalent
               and unevenly distributed in this region.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">The essay explains not only how pathogens cause malaria in humans but also how a changing
               climate and rapid deforestation are creating conditions in which mosquitoes reproduce.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">While biology can explain the effects of the virus on humans, Pière needs environmental
               science to help shed light on the uneven distribution of the disease in the region.

            <p class="Notebody">She characterizes the phenomenon of genetic manipulation of crops in detail and summarizes
               the debate on the topic. Her study places such debate in the intimate context of two

            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">By contextualizing the debate, Sharmila examines how cultural traditions, economic
               needs and beliefs mediate the adoption of, or resistance to, innovation.

            <p class="Notebody">Judy’s essay involves a critique of a historical monument commemorating the lives
               lost during the Rwanda genocide of 1994. Her paper offers an overview of the long-standing
               tribal conflicts in the region, the colonial era that suppressed public expression
               of such tension and the drastic decisions that led to the loss of nearly 800,000 lives.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">Historical insights illuminate her interpretation of the aesthetic choices and symbolism
               employed in the monument, such as the use of a sand clock to mark the unprecedented
               speed at which the genocide was unleashed, or the location proposed for the monument
               as one enters the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

            <p class="Notebody">
               <strong>Why does bringing these particular disciplines together in a study of this topic make

            <h2>[S] Multiple forms of integration</h2>
            <p>There are multiple forms of integration, and one of the interesting qualities of interdisciplinary
               learning is that disciplines can be brought together in surprising and meaningful
               ways. Four examples of these are:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>complex explanation</li>
               <li>contextualization</li>
               <li>transdisciplinary exploration</li>
               <li>artistic synthesis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Read the following descriptions of each type of integration. You will then be given
               four examples. Read them and decide which form of integration they represent.
            </p>
            <p class="NoteHeading1">Complex explanation</p>
            <p class="Notebody">Research questions often require you to understand why and how a complex event or
               phenomenon occurs. They may ask:
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">“Why is the climate changing?”</p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">“Why did individuals behave the way they did in the past?”</p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">“Why is heart disease more prominent among some human populations than others?”</p>
            <p class="Notebody">Addressing questions like this requires you to draw on expertise stemming from more
               than one subject discipline. You can then integrate the insights from the different
               disciplines to give a “complex explanation”. Interdisciplinary explanations of this
               kind offer a more comprehensive account of the problem than single disciplinary ones.
            </p>
            <p class="NoteHeading1">Contextualization</p>
            <p class="Notebody">Contextualization is the placing of a particular concept or issue arising in one discipline
               in a larger historical, cultural or philosophical framework. Viewing the concept or
               issue in a different framework sheds new meaning on it.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">For example, we understand Gregor Mendel’s discovery of patterns of genetic inheritance
               or Pablo Picasso’s creation of 
               <em>Guernica</em> differently when historians place them in their historical context.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">Similarly, you can integrate disciplines in meaningful ways when you examine the historical,
               cultural or philosophical context of the topic you are studying.
            </p>
            <p class="NoteHeading1">Transdisciplinary exploration</p>
            <p class="Notebody">You explore 
               <strong>transdisciplinary concepts</strong> or 
               <strong>crossover tools</strong> when you apply a concept or skill typically found in two or more disciplines across
               subjects. For example:
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">
               <strong>Careful observation</strong> is central to data collection in biology and life drawing in the arts.
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">
               <strong>Evidence-based reasoning</strong> is central to both history and physics.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">When you compare and contrast the use of these and similar concepts/tools across disciplines,
               you understand them in a more nuanced way. Some disciplinary tools, such as statistical
               modelling or systems thinking, are particularly easily and usefully applied across
               domains.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">You show integrative understanding based on transdisciplinary concepts when:</p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">you come to understand phenomena studied through the lens of multiple disciplines
               under a common conceptual frame (for example, systems theory), or
            </p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">you reach a better understanding of particular transdisciplinary concepts (evidence-based
               reasoning, careful observation) through comparing and contrasting their use in multiple
               disciplines.
            </p>
            <p class="NoteHeading1">Artistic synthesis</p>
            <p class="Notebody">You engage in an artistic synthesis when you examine an aesthetic interpretation of
               a non-artistic topic or issue. For example:
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">•	a historical monument commemorating the Second World War</p>
            <p class="Notebody">•	a poem interpreting climate change.</p>
            <p class="Notebody">Artistic synthesis deepens your understanding of a topic because you have to grapple
               with the issues in a new way. It requires you to:
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">•	translate your knowledge of the topic into evocative symbolism</p>
            <p class="Notebody">•	consider multiple possible interpretations</p>
            <p class="Notebody">•	evaluate whether such interpretations afford new insights into the topic under study.</p>
            <p class="Notebody">Successful artistic syntheses must meet aesthetic standards in the medium employed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p class="Tablebody">The essay explains not only how pathogens cause malaria in humans but also how a changing

               <h3>What is global consciousness?</h3>
               <p>Throughout the decades, Diploma Programme teachers have sought to promote traits such
                  as international-mindedness, intercultural understanding and global citizenship among
                  their students.
               </p>
               <p>Multiple terms have been used in international education to refer to desirable qualities
                  of mind and dispositions in a globally interdependent world:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Awareness</strong> denotes some knowledge and sensitivity to international or intercultural issues.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Perspective</strong> relates to global, national or cultural viewpoints.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>International</strong> or 
                     <strong>intercultural understanding</strong> refers to students’ understanding of the relationships between nations or cultures.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>International-mindedness</strong> describes a disposition of openness and curiosity about the world and deep understanding
                     of the complexity and diversity of human interactions.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Terms such as 
                  <strong>international</strong> or 
                  <strong>intercultural</strong> have been associated with specific countries, nation states and groups of people
                  with particular sets of values and experiences. The term 
                  <strong>global</strong> has been associated with views of the world as a whole or processes that impact upon
                  the whole planet.
               </p>
               <p>In the definition of 
                  <strong>global consciousness</strong> proposed here, 
                  <strong>global</strong> refers explicitly to local–global dynamics. These dynamics are not limited to a uniform
                  view of the whole world. Instead, they emphasize local–global developments and the
                  global contexts in which they take place.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Global consciousness</strong> is the capacity and disposition to understand and act upon issues of global significance.
                  It is the ability and willingness to understand oneself and others within the broader
                  matrix of our contemporary world.

               <h3>Global consciousness—a student portrait</h3>
               <p>Global consciousness is an elusive concept, which makes it difficult for teachers
                  to identify shared markers or indicators. It does not refer to a body of knowledge
                  that students need to master. It speaks of more perennial qualities of mind and heart—dispositions
                  or elements of character.
               </p>
               <p>To make qualities of global consciousness visible we turn to a student portrait.</p>
               <p class="NoteHeading1">Sahdal: Portrait of a globally conscious student</p>
               <p class="Notebody">Sahdal is a 12th grade student in Mombasa, Kenya. His WSEE focused on the relationship
                  between people’s religious affiliation and their level of understanding of HIV/AIDS.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">His interest in the topic developed in a biology class where students examined the
                  structure of the virus and its effect in the body, and mapped the spread of the disease
                  in Africa and worldwide.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">For his study he collected and compared data on attitudes and knowledge about HIV/AIDS
                  among young people, adults and leaders in the local Christian, Muslim and Hindu communities.
               </p>
               <p class="NoteHeading1">Global sensitivity</p>
               <p class="Notebody">Sahdal was upset to learn about the global magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and
                  its uneven distribution around the world. He had heard about it in the news before,
                  but had not realized how tragic the problem was, especially within poorer countries.
                  Learning about HIV/AIDS increased his 
                  <strong>alertness</strong> to the problem.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">He was also surprised to learn that he and his friends had a few misconceptions about
                  the disease and its transmission. Increasingly he noticed how often the topic appeared
                  in the news and brought clips to class. He came to recognize that the cases of HIV
                  he learned about were not isolated events but part of a larger regional epidemic.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Sahdal also noticed that many of his peers did not want to talk much about the disease.
                  Parents were not bringing the topic up and religious leaders seemed worried to do
                  so as well. Recognizing the tension between his peers’ silence and the need to be
                  informed, he focused his essay on the relationship between religious affiliation and
                  understanding of HIV/AIDS. He explains:

                  <strong>
                     <em>In Mombasa, tradition and religious morals are highly regarded. Because religious
                        leaders can be narrow-minded it is important to see whether these leaders limit or
                        promote awareness.
                     </em>
                  </strong>
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">In summary, how does Sahdal exhibit 
                  <strong>global sensitivity</strong>? He becomes more alert to the problem in its local and global dimensions, finding
                  opportunities to apply outside the classroom what he learns in class. He is more attentive
                  to media and community accounts of cases of the disease and brings up the topic among
                  his friends at school and in his 
                  <em>madrasah</em> (religious school).
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Recognizing that religious affiliations influence individual behaviour the world over,
                  Sahdal points to the particularly religious culture in Mombasa where multiple traditions
                  coexist.
               </p>
               <p class="NoteHeading1">Global understanding</p>
               <p class="Notebody">Sahdal understands HIV/AIDS as both a scientific and a social phenomenon. He can explain
                  how the virus causes AIDS, its structure and the kinds of cells it targets. He also
                  understands popular beliefs and misconceptions about the disease and how religion
                  and school control access to information.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Yet to exhibit a 
                  <strong>global</strong> understanding Sahdal must examine the relationship between the local and the global.
                  How do perceptions of HIV/AIDS in his local city of Mombasa relate to the broader
                  challenge of informing people around the world?
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">The beginning of Sahdal’s essay includes global statistics on HIV/AIDS worldwide and
                  compares them to regional and local indicators. This sets a global stage for his local
                  study.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">He has important opportunities to examine the global dimension of his study as the
                  paper unfolds. For example, Sahdal could examine how the three major world religions
                  portray matters of health and lifestyle. He could also examine public national campaigns
                  led by governments such as Uganda and Brazil.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">In conclusion, Sahdal exhibits 
                  <strong>global understanding</strong> in his capacity:
               </p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to frame a global epidemic in local terms</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to consider the perspectives of members of diverse religious traditions.</p>
               <p class="Notebody">Opportunities to further Sahdal’s global understanding include helping him:</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to move flexibly across local, national and global dimensions of HIV/AIDS</p>
               <p class="Notelist(bullet)">to ground his interpretation of religious perspectives in their fundamental principles.</p>
               <p class="NoteHeading1">Global self</p>
               <p class="Notebody">Sahdal’s engagement with the topic of HIV/AIDS does not stop at understanding the
                  problem. He believes that there are things he can do to ameliorate the situation—particularly
                  in his own Muslim community.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">
                  <strong>
                     <em>If I go and have HIV awareness sessions in my community madrasah (my religious school),
                        I can make a difference. I am just now planning sessions and awareness campaigns in
                        my community madrasah.

                  </strong>
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Participating, and viewing himself as an active member of local and global communities,
                  is a defining quality of Sahdal’s world view.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">In his diagram below, Sahdal identifies topics of global concern with ease—for example,
                  global warming, deforestation and destruction of animal habitats; religious intolerance
                  and violation of human rights; and lack of resources, droughts and famine.
               </p>
               <p class="Notebody">Most interestingly, he spontaneously notes his personal connections to each and describes
                  a variety of actions in which he is engaged to ameliorate the problems. Actions include
                  being a member of the school environment club for five years, volunteering at the
                  local humane society and working in a local charity.

               </p>
               <p>Sahdal exhibits a 
                  <strong>global self</strong> in that he visibly views himself as being affected by global phenomena. He views
                  his local actions as contributing to larger global developments. He is thoughtful
                  about the extent and limitations of his contribution. For instance, he explains:
               </p>
               <p class="Quote">The problem that worries me the most is religious extremism and intolerance. Every
                  day we hear about "suicide bombings", "Islamic militias", "Mujahedeen" and many innocent
                  people die from these attacks. I am concerned because the concept of extremism, which
                  some Muslims connect with religion, has no part with religion. This is something I
                  notice often and talk with my friends about. I, as a Muslim, suffer from discrimination
                  because of these views and in addition many people die. I am not doing much to make
                  a difference in this area. Maybe because where I live there is not much extremism,
                  trying to do something would not matter that much. However, if I decided to join activism
                  for peace, I would make more of a difference. Nowadays I feel sympathy and feel that
                  all I can do is pray, and that’s what I do.
               </p>
               <p>Sahdal’s portrait offers a window into the mind of a globally conscious student. It
                  shows that, to be globally conscious, students must:
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <strong>have information about the world</strong>
                  </li>
                  <li>exhibit a distinctive 
                     <strong>way of being in the world</strong>—
                  </li>
                  <li>be attentive to the ways in which global phenomena are manifested in local realities,
                     as well as their own and others’ realities
                  </li>
                  <li>be reflective about their own roles as participants in local, national and global
                     contexts.
                  </li>
               </ol>
               <p>Clearly students will exhibit global consciousness in very different ways. Sahdal
                  positions himself within issues and actions he deems important. Others may do so according
                  to the places where they have lived or influential people in their lives.
               </p>
               <p>Regardless of these differences, students exhibit global consciousness when:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>they are attentive to issues of global significance around them</li>
                  <li>they understand such issues in depth</li>
                  <li>they can place themselves as thinkers and actors in today’s complex and interdependent
                     world.
                  </li>
               </ul>

                           the general population uneducated, in ignorance about people and happenings outside.

                           the NGO, I was curious to know how the economic crises of big cities could affect
                           a small NGO operating in rural India. My love for economics made me think about the

            <h2>Nurturing global consciousness</h2>
            <p>Supervisors working with students on their WSEE enjoy a unique opportunity to:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>support students’ interdisciplinary research</li>
               <li>engage in reflections about what it means to be an internationally minded or globally
                  conscious person.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The IB expects that, during advisory sessions and through informal conversations,
               supervisors will encourage students to:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>be aware of opportunities to connect what they are learning with local and global
                  developments around them (global sensitivity)
               </li>
               <li>reflect about their own values, thoughts, commitments, concerns and possible actions
                  with regard to the topics they study
               </li>
               <li>make meaningful connections between their personal lives and the issues under study
                  (global self).

            <img src="**insert link url**" alt="**insert alt text**"></img>
            <p>Through their exchanges with students, supervisors will gain a better sense of their
               students’ unfolding global consciousness. Supervisors are requested to comment on
               this aspect of student development on the extended RPPF
               <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>.
            </p>
            <p>For example, teachers may characterize a student’s global consciousness considering
               the indicators above. They can provide evidence by describing:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>a pivotal learning moment</li>
               <li>the students’ discovery of self</li>
               <li>observation of the students’ spontaneous engagement with the topic outside of school</li>
               <li>a reflection on how the students have enriched their self-portraits as their project
                  unfolded.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supervisors' observations, and their supporting evidence, directly inform examiners
               when they assess the essay against criterion E: engagement.

            <p class="NoteHeading1">Important note on supervising a WSEE</p>
            <p class="Notebody">Students undertaking a WSEE should be allocated one supervisor, like other EE students.</p>
            <p class="Notebody">This may be:</p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">someone who is interested in the issue the student is exploring, or</p>
            <p class="Notelist(bullet)">a teacher of one of the Diploma Programme disciplines the student is using as part
               of their interdisciplinary approach.
            </p>
            <p class="Notebody">It is not necessary for students to be allocated two supervisors.</p>
            <p class="Notebody">For example, if a student is undertaking a WSEE using biology and economics, the biology
               teacher may act as the supervisor. The student can also interview an economics teacher
               about their chosen topic, but the economics teacher is an expert resource, not a supervisor.

                  </p>
                  <ul>

                     by:

                  <ul>
                     <li>bringing a new article for the students to discuss</li>
                     <li>engaging in informal conversations about students’ research experience and the potential
                        avenues for local and global participation it presents.

                  </ul>

                  <h4>Structures and routines</h4>

                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>related CAS projects</li>
                     <li>afterschool study groups</li>
                     <li>student-run seminars.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These can all provide a meaningful social structure and productive environments for
                     individual and group reflection about topics of global significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>The task of teaching students about the world contrasts with nurturing global consciousness.
                     The latter speaks to a more deeply owned set of dispositions and outlooks on world
                     and self.
                  </p>
                  <p>Global consciousness is thus best nurtured through a combination of:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the teaching and learning that students are exposed to as part of their Diploma Programme
                        education
                     </li>
                     <li>the tacit curriculum embedded in the school culture.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Students are most likely to develop global consciousness when they live in school
                     environments in which they “breathe” international-mindedness. In such schools, factors
                     like the ones listed above converge in creating rich environments for local and global
                     reflection and action.
                  </p>
                  <p>Students are encouraged to dedicate thoughtful time to the study of issues of global
                     significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>The school can offer students plenty of opportunities to examine global and local
                     topics in depth and express their views through, for example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>exhibitions</li>
                     <li>CAS initiatives</li>
                     <li>essay competitions</li>
                     <li>student newspapers.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The school also provides visible models of globally conscious behaviours, values and
                     life commitments. For example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>speakers</li>
                     <li>events</li>
                     <li>class projects.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Attending to local and global news, and reflecting on roles and positions, becomes
                     routine and part of social interactions and institutionalized structures through,
                     for example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>study groups</li>
                     <li>fairs</li>
                     <li>teachers’ meetings</li>
                     <li>school assemblies</li>
                     <li>student portfolio reviews.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Above all, teachers, students, parents and administrators in schools that aspire to
                     create a culture of global consciousness face the task of creating intellectually
                     engaging, ethically committed and trusting learning environments in which the world
                     around us becomes not only the context but also the content of a meaningful education.

            <h2>Understanding the assessment criteria</h2>
            <p>It is important that supervisors and students understand the assessment criteria and
               how these are applied by examiners to an EE.
            </p>
            <p>The EE is an externally assessed component of the Diploma Programme, marked by an
               IB examiner. Examiners are unaware of any predicted grade that a supervisor gives
               to the essay. The examiners simply apply the assessment criteria based on the evidence
               in front of them—the student’s work.
            </p>
            <p>It is important, therefore, that a students’ demonstration of the assessment criteria
               is clear and apparent.
            </p>
            <p>Supervisors and coordinators must ensure that students understand from the outset
               how they are to be assessed.
            </p>
            <p>For details of the assessment criteria please refer to the following sections of this
               site:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Assessment of the extended essay
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>
               </li>
               <li>Best-fit approach and level descriptors
                  <hi class="color(FF0000)">[LINK]</hi>

               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is also useful to understand how the assessment criteria are considered holistically
               across the whole essay. The following table gives some examples:
            </p>

                                    points from the statement in source A. One mark is awarded for
                                    each point correctly identified. Problems here were a
                                    rarity.</p>
                                <h3>Question 2</h3>
                                <p>Full marks were awarded to the candidate who made two
                                    well-developed points about why humanitarian intervention can
                                    often be the cause of protests and controversy. Referring to
                                    source B explicitly ensured that any examples given directly fed
                                    into the broader points.</p>
                                <h3>Question 3</h3>
                                <p>The candidate was both precise and focused on the question of the
                                        <em>legitimacy </em>of humanitarian intervention. The
                                    response makes effective use of the sources, with several
                                    well-developed points of contrast. The question was not asking
                                    to compare the two sources so no marks were reward for points of
                                    comparison.</p>
                                <h3>Question 4</h3>
                                <p>The candidate demonstrated sophisticated ability to construct and
                                    communicate coherent arguments and evaluation, making good use
                                    of appropriate vocabulary. Full and developed knowledge and
                                    understanding of humanitarian intervention and its limits in
                                    case of human rights violations is evident. There is a good
                                    balance between using the sources and own knowledge, although
                                    sources could have been drawn on even more.  </p>

                                <h3>Question 1</h3>
                                <p>The candidate approached the question in a sensible, structured
                                    way. The format is straightforward and effective. The question
                                    demands candidates to identify three main points from the
                                    statement in source A. One mark is awarded for each point
                                    correctly identified. Problems here were a rarity.  </p>
                                <h3>Question 2</h3>
                                <p>The candidate used information given in source B particularly
                                    effectively and demonstrates a high degree of holistic
                                    knowledge, relating this back to the case of Libya. </p>
                                <h3>Question 3</h3>
                                <p>The candidate aims to focus on the question of
                                        <em>legitimacy</em> of humanitarian intervention in Libya
                                    and makes some valid points, particularly towards the end of the
                                    answer, but much of the answer is descriptive of what the two
                                    sources say instead of contrasting their views.  </p>
                                <h3>Question 4</h3>
                                <p>The candidate used the sources to examine the claim, though is
                                    not always explicit about how the information they use from the
                                    sources relates to the question. Use of own examples is
                                    particularly effective in establishing an evaluative answer. The
                                    answer, though showing a strong command of the topic area, is
                                    lacking somewhat in coming across as a connected whole. </p>

                                <h3>Question 1</h3>
                                <p>The candidate approached the question in a sensible, structured
                                    way. The format is straightforward and effective. The question
                                    demands candidates to identify three main points from the
                                    statement in source A. One mark is awarded for each point
                                    correctly identified. Problems here were a rarity.  </p>
                                <h3>Question 2</h3>   <p>Although the candidate only refers to
                                    source B implicitly, the points they make are relevant,
                                    well-developed and formulated in appropriate political
                                    vocabulary. Students are advised to make more explicit links to
                                    the source, though.   </p>
                                <h3>Question 3</h3>   <p>The candidate focuses consistently on
                                    contrasting the sources in a well-structured way and makes
                                    relevant points, but some points are based on an understanding
                                    of the sources that may not be entirely accurate. </p>
                                <h3>Question 4</h3>   <p>The candidate demonstrates an ability to
                                    discuss competing viewpoints on the question and uses own
                                    knowledge well and sources somewhat. The candidate employs
                                    theories of global politics effectively for evaluative purposes.
                                    Some claims are quite hastily made and would require more
                                    justification for higher marks. </p>

                                <p>The essay explores various approaches and beliefs about the role
                                    of military power in global politics and explores arguments
                                    about its use and usefulness, and why the role of different
                                    forms of military power and other types of power may be
                                    changing. More contemporary examples would have tied the essay
                                    into the global politics syllabus even more, but the essay is
                                    clear with a good grasp of the key concepts, and arguments are
                                    well defended and structured. </p>

                                <p>The essay is firmly centered on the question and makes very good
                                    use of the key concepts of the course (not just sovereignty, but
                                    also power, globalization and interdependence) to develop a
                                    balanced view on state sovereignty. The student shows a rich
                                    understanding of the evolving nature of the role of the state
                                    vs. non-state actors, and examples are well-chosen and
                                    integrated in the arguments (especially early on in the essay).
                                    The question is examined from different perspectives. </p>

                                <p>A well-organized essay that considers relevant key concepts,
                                    their meaning and order in answer to the question. The essay
                                    starts by defining power, which is essential for this question.
                                    It would benefit from a more comprehensive definition of human
                                    rights, too, though despite absence of this, many good arguments
                                    and some counterarguments are put forward that illustrate the
                                    complexity of questions surrounding human rights (e.g. global
                                    evolutions, role of sovereignty, cultural relativism). The
                                    candidate concludes that the ideals of human rights are not
                                    achievable. Examples are presented, but some discussion on
                                    whether it is present day global politics or something else
                                    (e.g. a universal tendency for different cultures to disagree)
                                    that prevents realization of human rights could have benefited
                                    the justification for the final conclusion. </p>

                                    sovereignty, and the role that human rights plays within states
                                    and in inter-state relations. The candidate also understands the

                                <p>The introduction sets out the concept of development clearly and
                                    the student also shows they know what aid is. The examples of
                                    Somalia and Haiti (post-earthquake) work to support the
                                    arguments that instability and corruption prevent aid from
                                    aiding development (Somalia) but not always (Haiti). However,
                                    the claims made are quite general and not particularly well
                                    substantiated. There is also some force in the argument about
                                    the potential greater effectiveness of trade versus aid, but
                                    again the claim is made with little justification. In general,
                                    though the question is looked at from different perspectives,
                                    the arguments generalise based on little evidence. </p>

                                <p>Q6. The fundamental weakness of development goals (such as the
                                    Millenium Development Goals) is their lack of focus on how
                                    targets are actually to be achieved. To what extent do you agree
                                    with this claim? </p>

                                <p>The answer is very well structured and balanced, and the student
                                    shows a thorough knowledge of politics and global politics, and
                                    that contradictions can occur. The essay could be a bit stronger
                                    on fundamental political concepts and approaches, but an
                                    effective use of examples helps to illustrate these concepts by
                                    highlighting the problems and realities of global politics.
                                    Writing is evaluative throughout. </p>

                                            <strong>Note:</strong> Questions in the May 2014
                                            examination papers follow the specification of the pilot
                                            guide relevant for the May 2014 cohort. Similarly, the
                                            sample student answers were marked according to the
                                            markbands detailed in the pilot guide relevant for the
                                            May 2014 cohort. The qualitative examiner comments have
                                            been written with an eye to the markbands of the final
                                            course specification so as to be as helpful to teachers
                                            as possible. Although the May 2014 specification and
                                            markbands for P2 were quite close to the final iteration
                                            of the course, teachers should treat the samples with
                                            this information in mind and appreciate that their
                                            candidates are subject to the assessment requirements
                                            stated in the Diploma Programme <em>Global politics

                                <h3>Criterion A </h3>
                                <p>This is a well-organized and structured report that clearly
                                    raises the political issue of the participation of women in
                                    government, on the local, national and international levels. The
                                    desire to cover and compare all three levels (Oxford, the UK and
                                    other democratic countries internationally) does bury some of
                                    the focus but for the most part, the questions under
                                    investigation are clear, as is why this political issue is of
                                    interest. </p>
                                <h3> Criterion B </h3>
                                <p>The candidate’s engagement with female politicians at several
                                    levels is described well and allows the reader to be aware of
                                    the work and thought that went into the process. The candidate
                                    is particularly skilled at tying their experiences consistently
                                    to their chosen political issue; for example, they are able to
                                    place the female politicians in their political contexts. The
                                    explanation and methodology of the engagement could have
                                    benefited from some engagement with men and their participation,
                                    as the two topics are connected. However, the data from the
                                    activities undertaken are well integrated into the report. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion C </h3>
                                <p>In their analysis of the issue, the candidate presents some
                                    possibilities of why there is not more participation by women in
                                    the formal political realm based on their engagement. The
                                    analysis might have taken a broader view of men’ versus women’s
                                    participation, and the factors that contributed to each sector’s
                                    overall activity and participation; it would have benefited from
                                    more research to accompany the experiential evidence. What the
                                    candidate does present, however, is very good. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion D </h3>
                                <p>As stated, some more research could have presented the candidate
                                    with material that would have allowed for a bit more
                                    sophistication in their final analysis, including consideration
                                    of counterclaims, which are largely missing from the report. The
                                    candidate does tie power into their analysis on the domestic,
                                    local, and state levels, and a comparison of the various levels
                                    would have provided the reader with some extra understanding of
                                    the comparison the student was attempting. Some interesting
                                    practices, such as hectoring on the benches, and some larger
                                    issues, such as the recognized and assumed division of labor in
                                    societies and how they relate to politics are mentioned and
                                    these are a good start for further research and engagement. In
                                    general, the report is very concise with impressive engagement.
                                    It could easily be expanded into further research and
                                    exploration. </p>

                                            <strong>Note: </strong> The engagement activity written
                                            reports (and corresponding engagements) reflect the
                                            specification of the Global politics Pilot guide (for
                                            examinations in May 2014). However, given that the task
                                            has evolved through the global politics pilot, the work
                                            was marked and commented against the engagement activity
                                            specification and assessment criteria of the final
                                            iteration of the course. Teachers should regard the
                                            samples with this information in mind and appreciate
                                            that their candidates are subject to the assessment
                                            requirements stated in the Diploma Programme <em>Global
                                                politics guide</em> . </p>
                                        <p> Many written reports in the May 2014 session, as also
                                            reflected in these samples, did not include consistent
                                            referencing or in-text citations, but candidates
                                            considered it sufficient to include research consulted
                                            in a bibliography. Students <strong>must</strong>
                                            reference their sources in the text. This is a
                                            requirement of academic honesty, and must be paid
                                            particular attention to. </p>

                                <p>The candidate’s explicit political issue of examining a specific
                                    NGO’s strategies and challenges in relation to women’s rights is
                                    clear and well-defined in relation to the completed engagement;
                                    however, the implied political issue, which the candidate goes
                                    on to analyse – women’s rights in a diverse region – is very
                                    broad in relation to what is possible to discover through a
                                    single interview. The motivation for studying the issue is
                                    well-presented. </p>
                                <h3> Criterion B </h3>
                                <p> Interviewing a key stakeholder and insider within Amnesty
                                    International is relevant for the study of the student’s
                                    political issue. The candidate’s questions in the interview were
                                    clear, directed towards the political issue, and it is evident
                                    that the student is knowledgeable on this subject and was able
                                    to ask intelligent questions. It is clear that the interview
                                    informed the candidate’s understanding of the issue. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion C </h3>
                                <p>The candidate has used the interview impressively in their
                                    analysis and is able to lift the answers to a higher level of
                                    abstraction (e.g. understanding of the dichotomy between
                                    political and cultural subjects and the degree to which this
                                    dichotomy is a social construction and how it relates to the
                                    behaviour of states; role of NGOs vis-a-vis states). Although
                                    some further research was conducted as a result of ideas
                                    emerging from the interview, further engagement and research
                                    would have provided more support for the analysis, as many
                                    statements are generalisations based on limited evidence. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion D </h3>
                                <p>The candidate does a good job of trying to understand the bigger
                                    political forces impacting on gender issues and NGOs’ work in
                                    the MENA region as a result of her interview. However, the
                                    report would have benefited from other engagement-based
                                    perspectives (as well as more research, as mentioned above):
                                    there is much written about this subject and many points of
                                    view. The candidate relies much on her one interview giving her
                                    one perspective. </p>

                                            reports (and corresponding engagements) reflect the
                                            specification of the Global politics Pilot guide (for
                                            examinations in May 2014). However, given that the task
                                            has evolved through the global politics pilot, the work
                                            was marked and commented against the engagement activity
                                            specification and assessment criteria of the final
                                            iteration of the course. Teachers should regard the
                                            samples with this information in mind and appreciate
                                            that their candidates are subject to the assessment
                                            requirements stated in the Diploma Programme <em>Global
                                                politics guide</em>. </p>
                                        <p> Many written reports in the May 2014 session, as also
                                            reflected in these samples, did not include consistent
                                            referencing or in-text citations, but candidates
                                            considered it sufficient to include research consulted
                                            in a bibliography. Students <strong>must</strong>
                                            reference their sources in the text. This is a
                                            requirement of academic honesty, and must be paid
                                            particular attention to. </p>

                                <p>The candidate does not explicitly identify a <em>political</em>
                                    issue they wish to investigate, though they make it clear that
                                    they have engaged in a youth awareness campaign on HIV/AIDS
                                    (there would be many political issues embedded in such an
                                    engagement but none have been identified). The candidate’s
                                    interest in the issue is based on a desire to find out more
                                    about HIV/AIDS in their home region. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion B</h3>
                                <p>The candidate, though spending much of the report on describing
                                    the campaign in general terms, describes also what they did as
                                    their engagement. It is clear that the student learned much
                                    about HIV/AIDS-related citizenship activism and its limits and
                                    opportunities through the fieldwork. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion C</h3>

                                <p>The response is largely descriptive and there is little attempt
                                    to make use of theoretical perspectives. This is difficult
                                    without an explicitly identified political issue that would give
                                    the analysis a clear scope. </p>

                                <h3>Criterion D</h3>

                                <p>The candidate attempts to generalise their findings in places,
                                    and place them in the wider context of Tanzanian development
                                    issues, but evaluation is limited, again largely due to lack of
                                    a clear political issue. </p>

                                            reflected in these samples, did not include consistent
                                            referencing or in-text citations, but candidates
                                            considered it sufficient to include research consulted
                                            in a bibliography. Students <strong>must</strong>
                                            reference their sources in the text. This is a
                                            requirement of academic honesty, and must be paid
                                            particular attention to. </p>

                                    <em>The student demonstrates a very good understanding of a
                                        political issue raised by the case study, with a generally
                                        clear and focused analysis and an acknowledgement of
                                        different perspectives on the issue.</em>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <em>The student makes effective connections between the case
                                        study and the wider context of global politics. </em>
                                </p>

                                <p>A very solid presentation with recurring moments of analysis and
                                    evaluation; however, some diffuseness marks the overall
                                    narrative and presentation, which is why the candidate did not
                                    earn the mark of excellent. For your discussion, consider how
                                    students can create a narrative without the help of a detailed
                                    PowerPoint.</p>
