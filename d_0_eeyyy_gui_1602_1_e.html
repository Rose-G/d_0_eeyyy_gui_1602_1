                <div class="chapter">
                    <h2>The Diploma programme [Placeholder h2]</h2>
                    <p>The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and be able to evaluate a range of points of view.
                        </p><h3>The Diploma Programme model</h3><p>
                        The programme is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility and can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

                        </div>
                    <h3>Choosing the right combination</h3>
                    <p>Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can choose a second subject from groups 1 to 5 instead of a group 6 subject. Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
                      </p> <p>At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework that is assessed by teachers.

                <h1>General introduction to the core of the Diploma Programme</h1>
                <div class="chapter">
                    <h2>The core of the Diploma Programme</h2>
                    <p>All Diploma Programme students participate in the three elements that make up the core of the programme:</p>
                       <ul><li>theory of knowledge</li>
                       <li>creativity, activity and service</li>
                        <li>the extended essay.</li></ul>
                       <p> These three elements of the core complement each other, working together to achieve the following common aims:
                       </p><ul><li>to support, and be supported by, the academic disciplines
                        </li><li>to foster international-mindedness
                       </li><li>to develop self-awareness and a sense of identity.</li></ul>
                        
                       <p><strong>Theory of knowledge (TOK)</strong> is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The role of TOK is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of their own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
                        </p><p><strong>Creativity, activity, service (CAS)</strong> is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are:
                        </p>
                    <ul><li>creativity (arts and other experiences that involve creative thinking)
                        </li><li>activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) 
                        </li><li>service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). 
                        </li></ul>
                    <p>The emphasis in CAS is on helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. 
                        </p><p>Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
                      </p> <p><strong>The extended essay</strong>, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. Students select an area of research from Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of the interdisciplinary world studies essay from two subjects, and  become acquainted with the independent research and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. As an authentic learning experience, the extended essay provides students with an opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

               <h3>Overview of the body [heading 3]</h3>
               
               
               <p>The anthropology of the body is an exciting and diverse area of research which provides
                  a balance between more classic areas of anthropological study, such as the ritualised
                  body or localised bodies, and new emerging areas, such as experiential bodies or mechanised
                  bodies. However the body, or bodies, are examined what is clear within this area of
                  research is the centrality of the body to understanding how people experience and
                  make sense of their worlds.
               </p>
               
               <p>Whilst it was Marcel Mauss in 1936 who argued that ‘body techniques’ should be the
                  focus of anthropological study, it was not until much later that ‘the body’ as an
                  area of research began to emerge with any dominance in social and cultural anthropology.
                  These areas of research have sought to explore the body as more than a ‘natural object’
                  but instead a constitutive dimension of everyday cultural and social practices.  In
                  other words, how meanings and values are produced on, and about the body.
               </p>
               
               <p>Theorising about the body within anthropology has been prolific in recent years and
                  more recently has been closely linked to the rise in questions about the bio-politics,
                  suffering, and commodification: Mauss (1985) talked about how people are enculturated
                  through their bodies; Douglas (2002) refers to the role of the body as a metaphor
                  for making sense of the world; Foucault (1973, 1977) argued that we are trained through
                  our bodies to be modern subjects; Csordas (1990, 1994) seeks to understand human participation
                  in the cultural world through embodied experience and Turner (1996) points out that
                  projects of the self are also projects of the body; even Bourdieu (1977) offers his
                  theory of ‘habitus’ to explore the relationship between social structure and embodied
                  experience; and the Comaroff’s have highlighted the role of corporality in the practices
                  of opposition and resistance. 
               </p>
               
               <p>In this area of inquiry, the centrality of the body in anthropology can be explored
                  in a number of contexts, and through a range of inquiry specific concepts. An examination
                  of ‘the body’ as a historically and culturally contingent category, which can for
                  example be seen as the material focus of ‘everyday practices’, whether as an object
                  of self-identification, or the subject of social control, for example. In teaching
                  this area of inquiry the following questions may be useful in framing discussions:
                
               </p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>How is culture inscribed on the body?</li>
                  
                  <li>How do persons inhabit bodies?</li>
                  
                  <li>How are mechanised and medical technologies changing the ways in which people think
                     about and experience the body?
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Can we have persons without bodies and bodies without persons? In other words, what
                     is the relationship between the body and the self?
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>How is the body used as a form of resistance to the mechanisms of power?</li>
                  
                  <li>In what ways is the human body shaped by socio-cultural, historical and political
                     processes? Furthermore, how in turn does it shape them?
                   
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               <p>This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings which serve
                  as analytical frameworks, and topic based exploration. In approaching the teaching
                  of this area of inquiry it would be useful to begin with examining how human bodies
                  are the product of both biology and culture and compare the relationship between the
                  body, mind and society across time and place. The body should be explored critically
                  questioning the notion of it as a natural, universal object. It should be explored
                  in terms of how bodies are perceived, understood, and experienced in a number of contexts.
                  In others words, in choosing the topics to study and ethnographies to read attention
                  should be given to the body as a lived experience encompassing all its social and
                  symbolic relationships.

                             <p>This TSM has been written by IB teachers experienced in supporting students and fellow teachers through the EE component of the Diploma Programme. 
                             </p><p>Its advice is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive, but is designed to:</p>
                            <ul><li>Support both experienced and less experienced EE coordinators and supervisors (Experienced coordinators and supervisors will find it helpful to view What’s new in EE 2016).
                             </li><li>Complement IB professional development</li>
                             <li>Make links with other helpful and relevant IB documents</li>
                             <li>Encourage collaboration and discussion about the EE process between those involved (coordinators, supervisors, librarians and students)
                            </li><li>Provide the theoretical background and practical tools to enable teachers to support and guide their students’ learning through the EE process. 
                             </li></ul>
                        <h3>Contents</h3>
                            <p>The material consists of background information and resources for EE coordinators and supervisors. Some of the resources are also for students. The TSM is divided into four sections. The third section provides specific support for the world studies extended essay – although there may be aspects that are useful for supervisors and students of disciplinary essays. All other sections apply to all extended essays, including the world studies.
                             </p><ul><li><p>An overview of the extended essay</p>
                             <p>This section provides a summary of what the extended essay involves and describes how it fits in within the core of the Diploma Programme.</p></li></ul>
                         <ul><li><p>Pedagogical support for the extended essay</p>
                            <p>This section offers practical advice and support for creating conditions for student success. It outlines the setting up of the relationship between supervisor and student, then provides background information and resources for the research and writing process and reflection.
                             </p></li></ul>
                         
                         <ul><li><p>Supporting the world studies extended essay: this section explains how the process differs for students who decide to write a world studies extended essay.
                            </p> <p>Assessing the extended essay: this section provides an insight into the assessment criteria and how you can help students understand the expectations with regard to these. It includes examples of student work at different grades with comments and marks from examiners across a number of different subjects.
                             </p>
                             </li></ul>
                         <p>This teacher support material builds on research and practice and is designed to help coordinators and supervisors guide student learning, who are encouraged to read the various sections before they embark on supervision.  They should then revisit particular sections as needed.  Selected sections will be useful in terms of collaborative planning, particularly those in relation to the implementation of the EE process, supervision and reflection sessions.  
                             </p><h3>Students and the TSM</h3>
                             <p>It is the supervisor’s role to judge the particular needs of students at specific moments in the research process; it is intended that some sections of this teacher support material be shared with students during supervision sessions, as deemed appropriate.  However, the materials provided here are not intended to replace the supervisor’s role and should not be shared with students in full.  When using any of the materials with students, teachers will need to discuss with them how they will inform their research.

                                papers 1 and 2 were quite close to the final iteration, teachers

                                <h3>Question 1</h3>
                                <p>The candidate approached the question in a sensible, structured
                                    way. The question demands candidates to identify three main
                                    points from the statement in source A. One mark is awarded for
                                    each point correctly identified. Problems here were a
                                    rarity.</p>
                                <h3>Question 2</h3>
                                <p>Full marks were awarded to the candidate who made two
                                    well-developed points about why humanitarian intervention can
                                    often be the cause of protests and controversy. Referring to
                                    source B explicitly ensured that any examples given directly fed
                                    into the broader points.</p>
                                <h3>Question 3</h3>
                                <p>The candidate was both precise and focused on the question of the
                                        <em>legitimacy </em>of humanitarian intervention. The
                                    response makes effective use of the sources, with several
                                    well-developed points of contrast. The question was not asking
                                    to compare the two sources so no marks were reward for points of
                                    comparison.</p>
                                <h3>Question 4</h3>
                                <p>The candidate demonstrated sophisticated ability to construct and
                                    communicate coherent arguments and evaluation, making good use
                                    of appropriate vocabulary. Full and developed knowledge and
                                    understanding of humanitarian intervention and its limits in
                                    case of human rights violations is evident. There is a good
                                    balance between using the sources and own knowledge, although
                                    sources could have been drawn on even more.  </p>

                                <h3>Question 1</h3>
                                <p>The candidate approached the question in a sensible, structured
                                    way. The format is straightforward and effective. The question
                                    demands candidates to identify three main points from the
                                    statement in source A. One mark is awarded for each point
                                    correctly identified. Problems here were a rarity.  </p>
                                <h3>Question 2</h3>
                                <p>The candidate used information given in source B particularly
                                    effectively and demonstrates a high degree of holistic
                                    knowledge, relating this back to the case of Libya. </p>
                                <h3>Question 3</h3>
                                <p>The candidate aims to focus on the question of
                                        <em>legitimacy</em> of humanitarian intervention in Libya
                                    and makes some valid points, particularly towards the end of the
                                    answer, but much of the answer is descriptive of what the two
                                    sources say instead of contrasting their views.  </p>
                                <h3>Question 4</h3>
                                <p>The candidate used the sources to examine the claim, though is
                                    not always explicit about how the information they use from the
                                    sources relates to the question. Use of own examples is
                                    particularly effective in establishing an evaluative answer. The
                                    answer, though showing a strong command of the topic area, is
                                    lacking somewhat in coming across as a connected whole. </p>

                                <h3>Question 1</h3>
                                <p>The candidate approached the question in a sensible, structured
                                    way. The format is straightforward and effective. The question
                                    demands candidates to identify three main points from the
                                    statement in source A. One mark is awarded for each point
                                    correctly identified. Problems here were a rarity.  </p>
                                <h3>Question 2</h3>   <p>Although the candidate only refers to
                                    source B implicitly, the points they make are relevant,
                                    well-developed and formulated in appropriate political
                                    vocabulary. Students are advised to make more explicit links to
                                    the source, though.   </p>
                                <h3>Question 3</h3>   <p>The candidate focuses consistently on
                                    contrasting the sources in a well-structured way and makes
                                    relevant points, but some points are based on an understanding
                                    of the sources that may not be entirely accurate. </p>
                                <h3>Question 4</h3>   <p>The candidate demonstrates an ability to
                                    discuss competing viewpoints on the question and uses own
                                    knowledge well and sources somewhat. The candidate employs
                                    theories of global politics effectively for evaluative purposes.
                                    Some claims are quite hastily made and would require more
                                    justification for higher marks. </p>

                                <p>The essay explores various approaches and beliefs about the role
                                    of military power in global politics and explores arguments
                                    about its use and usefulness, and why the role of different
                                    forms of military power and other types of power may be
                                    changing. More contemporary examples would have tied the essay
                                    into the global politics syllabus even more, but the essay is
                                    clear with a good grasp of the key concepts, and arguments are
                                    well defended and structured. </p>

                                <p>The essay is firmly centered on the question and makes very good
                                    use of the key concepts of the course (not just sovereignty, but
                                    also power, globalization and interdependence) to develop a
                                    balanced view on state sovereignty. The student shows a rich
                                    understanding of the evolving nature of the role of the state
                                    vs. non-state actors, and examples are well-chosen and
                                    integrated in the arguments (especially early on in the essay).
                                    The question is examined from different perspectives. </p>

                                <p>A well-organized essay that considers relevant key concepts,
                                    their meaning and order in answer to the question. The essay
                                    starts by defining power, which is essential for this question.
                                    It would benefit from a more comprehensive definition of human
                                    rights, too, though despite absence of this, many good arguments
                                    and some counterarguments are put forward that illustrate the
                                    complexity of questions surrounding human rights (e.g. global
                                    evolutions, role of sovereignty, cultural relativism). The
                                    candidate concludes that the ideals of human rights are not
                                    achievable. Examples are presented, but some discussion on
                                    whether it is present day global politics or something else
                                    (e.g. a universal tendency for different cultures to disagree)
                                    that prevents realization of human rights could have benefited
                                    the justification for the final conclusion. </p>

                                    and in inter-state relations. The candidate also understands the

                                <p>The introduction sets out the concept of development clearly and
                                    the student also shows they know what aid is. The examples of
                                    Somalia and Haiti (post-earthquake) work to support the
                                    arguments that instability and corruption prevent aid from
                                    aiding development (Somalia) but not always (Haiti). However,
                                    the claims made are quite general and not particularly well
                                    substantiated. There is also some force in the argument about
                                    the potential greater effectiveness of trade versus aid, but
                                    again the claim is made with little justification. In general,
                                    though the question is looked at from different perspectives,
                                    the arguments generalise based on little evidence. </p>

                                <p>Q6. The fundamental weakness of development goals (such as the
                                    Millenium Development Goals) is their lack of focus on how
                                    targets are actually to be achieved. To what extent do you agree
                                    with this claim? </p>

                                <p>The answer is very well structured and balanced, and the student
                                    shows a thorough knowledge of politics and global politics, and
                                    that contradictions can occur. The essay could be a bit stronger
                                    on fundamental political concepts and approaches, but an
                                    effective use of examples helps to illustrate these concepts by
                                    highlighting the problems and realities of global politics.

                                            <strong>Note:</strong> Questions in the May 2014
                                            examination papers follow the specification of the pilot
                                            guide relevant for the May 2014 cohort. Similarly, the
                                            sample student answers were marked according to the
                                            markbands detailed in the pilot guide relevant for the
                                            May 2014 cohort. The qualitative examiner comments have
                                            been written with an eye to the markbands of the final
                                            course specification so as to be as helpful to teachers
                                            as possible. Although the May 2014 specification and
                                            markbands for P2 were quite close to the final iteration
                                            of the course, teachers should treat the samples with
                                            this information in mind and appreciate that their
                                            candidates are subject to the assessment requirements
                                            stated in the Diploma Programme <em>Global politics

                                <h3>Criterion A </h3>
                                <p>This is a well-organized and structured report that clearly
                                    raises the political issue of the participation of women in
                                    government, on the local, national and international levels. The
                                    desire to cover and compare all three levels (Oxford, the UK and
                                    other democratic countries internationally) does bury some of
                                    the focus but for the most part, the questions under
                                    investigation are clear, as is why this political issue is of
                                    interest. </p>
                                <h3> Criterion B </h3>
                                <p>The candidate’s engagement with female politicians at several
                                    levels is described well and allows the reader to be aware of
                                    the work and thought that went into the process. The candidate
                                    is particularly skilled at tying their experiences consistently
                                    to their chosen political issue; for example, they are able to
                                    place the female politicians in their political contexts. The
                                    explanation and methodology of the engagement could have
                                    benefited from some engagement with men and their participation,
                                    as the two topics are connected. However, the data from the
                                    activities undertaken are well integrated into the report. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion C </h3>
                                <p>In their analysis of the issue, the candidate presents some
                                    possibilities of why there is not more participation by women in
                                    the formal political realm based on their engagement. The
                                    analysis might have taken a broader view of men’ versus women’s
                                    participation, and the factors that contributed to each sector’s
                                    overall activity and participation; it would have benefited from
                                    more research to accompany the experiential evidence. What the
                                    candidate does present, however, is very good. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion D </h3>
                                <p>As stated, some more research could have presented the candidate
                                    with material that would have allowed for a bit more
                                    sophistication in their final analysis, including consideration
                                    of counterclaims, which are largely missing from the report. The
                                    candidate does tie power into their analysis on the domestic,
                                    local, and state levels, and a comparison of the various levels
                                    would have provided the reader with some extra understanding of
                                    the comparison the student was attempting. Some interesting
                                    practices, such as hectoring on the benches, and some larger
                                    issues, such as the recognized and assumed division of labor in
                                    societies and how they relate to politics are mentioned and
                                    these are a good start for further research and engagement. In
                                    general, the report is very concise with impressive engagement.
                                    It could easily be expanded into further research and
                                    exploration. </p>

                                            <strong>Note: </strong> The engagement activity written
                                            reports (and corresponding engagements) reflect the
                                            specification of the Global politics Pilot guide (for
                                            examinations in May 2014). However, given that the task
                                            has evolved through the global politics pilot, the work
                                            was marked and commented against the engagement activity
                                            specification and assessment criteria of the final
                                            iteration of the course. Teachers should regard the
                                            samples with this information in mind and appreciate
                                            that their candidates are subject to the assessment
                                            requirements stated in the Diploma Programme <em>Global
                                                politics guide</em> . </p>
                                        <p> Many written reports in the May 2014 session, as also
                                            reflected in these samples, did not include consistent
                                            referencing or in-text citations, but candidates
                                            considered it sufficient to include research consulted
                                            in a bibliography. Students <strong>must</strong>
                                            reference their sources in the text. This is a
                                            requirement of academic honesty, and must be paid
                                            particular attention to. </p>

                                <p>The candidate’s explicit political issue of examining a specific
                                    NGO’s strategies and challenges in relation to women’s rights is
                                    clear and well-defined in relation to the completed engagement;
                                    however, the implied political issue, which the candidate goes
                                    on to analyse – women’s rights in a diverse region – is very
                                    broad in relation to what is possible to discover through a
                                    single interview. The motivation for studying the issue is
                                    well-presented. </p>
                                <h3> Criterion B </h3>
                                <p> Interviewing a key stakeholder and insider within Amnesty
                                    International is relevant for the study of the student’s
                                    political issue. The candidate’s questions in the interview were
                                    clear, directed towards the political issue, and it is evident
                                    that the student is knowledgeable on this subject and was able
                                    to ask intelligent questions. It is clear that the interview
                                    informed the candidate’s understanding of the issue. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion C </h3>
                                <p>The candidate has used the interview impressively in their
                                    analysis and is able to lift the answers to a higher level of
                                    abstraction (e.g. understanding of the dichotomy between
                                    political and cultural subjects and the degree to which this
                                    dichotomy is a social construction and how it relates to the
                                    behaviour of states; role of NGOs vis-a-vis states). Although
                                    some further research was conducted as a result of ideas
                                    emerging from the interview, further engagement and research
                                    would have provided more support for the analysis, as many
                                    statements are generalisations based on limited evidence. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion D </h3>
                                <p>The candidate does a good job of trying to understand the bigger
                                    political forces impacting on gender issues and NGOs’ work in
                                    the MENA region as a result of her interview. However, the
                                    report would have benefited from other engagement-based
                                    perspectives (as well as more research, as mentioned above):
                                    there is much written about this subject and many points of
                                    view. The candidate relies much on her one interview giving her
                                    one perspective. </p>

                                            <strong>Note: </strong> The engagement activity written
                                            reports (and corresponding engagements) reflect the
                                            specification of the Global politics Pilot guide (for
                                            examinations in May 2014). However, given that the task
                                            has evolved through the global politics pilot, the work
                                            was marked and commented against the engagement activity
                                            specification and assessment criteria of the final
                                            iteration of the course. Teachers should regard the
                                            samples with this information in mind and appreciate
                                            that their candidates are subject to the assessment
                                            requirements stated in the Diploma Programme <em>Global
                                                politics guide</em>. </p>
                                        <p> Many written reports in the May 2014 session, as also
                                            reflected in these samples, did not include consistent
                                            referencing or in-text citations, but candidates
                                            considered it sufficient to include research consulted
                                            in a bibliography. Students <strong>must</strong>
                                            reference their sources in the text. This is a
                                            requirement of academic honesty, and must be paid
                                            particular attention to. </p>

                                <p>The candidate does not explicitly identify a <em>political</em>
                                    issue they wish to investigate, though they make it clear that
                                    they have engaged in a youth awareness campaign on HIV/AIDS
                                    (there would be many political issues embedded in such an
                                    engagement but none have been identified). The candidate’s
                                    interest in the issue is based on a desire to find out more
                                    about HIV/AIDS in their home region. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion B</h3>
                                <p>The candidate, though spending much of the report on describing
                                    the campaign in general terms, describes also what they did as
                                    their engagement. It is clear that the student learned much
                                    about HIV/AIDS-related citizenship activism and its limits and
                                    opportunities through the fieldwork. </p>
                                <h3>Criterion C</h3>

                                <p>The response is largely descriptive and there is little attempt
                                    to make use of theoretical perspectives. This is difficult
                                    without an explicitly identified political issue that would give
                                    the analysis a clear scope. </p>

                                <h3>Criterion D</h3>

                                <p>The candidate attempts to generalise their findings in places,
                                    and place them in the wider context of Tanzanian development
                                    issues, but evaluation is limited, again largely due to lack of

                                            considered it sufficient to include research consulted

                                    <em>The student demonstrates a very good understanding of a
                                        political issue raised by the case study, with a generally
                                        clear and focused analysis and an acknowledgement of
                                        different perspectives on the issue.</em>

                                    <em>The student makes effective connections between the case
                                        study and the wider context of global politics. </em>

                                <p>A very solid presentation with recurring moments of analysis and
                                    evaluation; however, some diffuseness marks the overall
                                    narrative and presentation, which is why the candidate did not
                                    earn the mark of excellent. For your discussion, consider how
                                    students can create a narrative without the help of a detailed
                                    PowerPoint.</p>
